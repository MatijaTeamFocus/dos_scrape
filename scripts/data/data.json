Increasing the base block size means a hard fork, that does mean the coin splits into two different coins which Bitcoin cash, Bitcoin gold and I \"think\" b2x will be doing.  \n\nThe other option is to *reduce the size of each transaction* which effectively *is* a block size increase.  This allows you to fit more transactions inside each block -- the same outcome a larger block does.  The upside of this is approach is that it does not necessarily mean you have to do a hard fork.  This is what segwit does.  It moves part of the transaction off the main blockchain, allowing more transactions to fit in a block and since its backwards compatible (segwit or non-segwit are both fully valid bitcoin transactions) it did not require a hard fork.","ups":2,"downs":0,"score":2,"created":1514415853,"depth":1,"comments":""},{"body":"Hope it's a genuine question and I'm not loosing my time here.\n\nFirst you should psy no attention to that b2x thing, it is of no importance.\n\nBitcoin will not \"slowly die\", it evolves with each release. Some changes can be done with soft forks where old versions are still functional and others, like block size, which are done with hard forks and must be consensual because everybody has to upgrade together or a new coin will be created.

This has NOTHING to do with the Jeff Garzik crusade to reinvent bitcoin with no replay protection.\n\nThe brilliance is that they claim massive support by pointing to outdated exchange and other posts referring the since abandoned segwit2x fork.\n\nSee below for some additional analysis on why this is obviously a boiler room operation.\n\nMeanwhile Coinbase has seen a mass exodus of BTC\n\nDue to high volume, we are experiencing a backlog of outgoing transactions for BTC and ETH.\n\nRemember that the same thing happened with Bitcoin Cash late July, 2017. So What? Bitcoin did fine afterwards right?\n\nThis and the other dozen brazen attempts to mislead and co-opt \"bitcoin\" is causing traffic, temporarily driving up the bitcoin price and will probably attract some seedy miners, exchanges or other legitimate bitcoin resources.\n\nUninformed will lose money, resources will be siphoned, media will jump on the hype and the stench will affect all of us. This is making Roger Ver and Bcash smell like perfume!

By buying before Jan 1 2018, you can hold until Jan 1 2019 and avoid paying short-term capital gains taxes while also avoiding needing to settle up on those taxes until April 2020, when 2019 taxes are due. There is a lot of time for you do constructive things with that captured value potentially in that time.  \n  \nAlso, we should see Lightning Network (LN) on BTC mainnet by then, which should be very bullish for prices as the coin will have a greatly increased utility.

Developers are not as interested in achieving \"price goals\" and you should be VERY happy about that. If the goal is only to get the price as high as possible, then they will always cut corners and overhype everything.\n\n\nBitcoin Core developers want to build sound technology that will change the world in the long term.

The primary goal of Bitcoin is censorship resistance though, it should not try to cater to many of the new people who onboarded and insist on all having instant near free on-chain transactions. That’s a losing battle which compromises everything else we’ve built up.\n\nThe developers are definitely interested in UX, within the realm of what is possible to achieve for them. By switching to 16MB blocks or whatever, you embark on a permanent path you can’t turn back from. A bad call will permanently screw you in the future. One of the aspects of that step is cutting out all Tor nodes, providing full transparency on where all nodes are hosted.\n\nWhat do you think will begin to happen to Bitcoin when its market cap is in the trillions, it is challenging central banking and there are only a few hundred nodes left, most of which controlled by for-profit companies under government pressure?\n\nShow me the data that proves it would cut out almost nobody. It sounds to me like you haven’t ran a node and you’re just assuming everyone is in the privileged position you are.\n\nIf you’re upset Bitcoin doesn’t make you enough money, by all means go to another cryptocurrency with bold claims that will run into the same scalability challenges. If it was as simple as changing one parameter, it would’ve been done long ago.

Bitcoin gets mined in coins, but can be traded / exchanged in fractional coins all the way down to Satoshi.  Does the block chain have to keep track of every individual satoshi and the associated address, that seem silly slow and wasteful.  So how does blockchain deal with coin unit fragmentation?  My balance could have originated from multiple sources, but when I transfer it all to one address, presumably the part bits have to be transferred rather than a single unit of whatever size.  Given there is full audit tracability in the blockchain of which addresses any part of a coin got transferred through then that argues the fragments have to be tracked.  If that is true.. then while Bitcoin is relatively unpopular / low value the fragments will be larger but if Bitsoin displaces FIAT which will also likely mean the value rapidly grows then transactions will be in ever smaller fractions of a coin and conceivable the whole block of issued coins gets increasingly fragmented into smaller and smaller chunks.

So it is not so much that a specific coin which arrived from a specific input is transferred to a new public address, but that an ammount is debited from the one public address and credited to another.\n\nSo if i am right in my head with that, you dont have to worry about fractional coins because we are not tracking explicitly uniquely identifiable tokens beyond they constitute part of a balance.  So thinking this through if A and B transfer 1 and 2 coin ressepctively to C, and C then transfers 0.5 coin to D, while the balance of C is now 2.5 - there is not identity or concept of what that is comprised of other than the input less the output.  I.e we can not say C's balance is 0.5 of the original A coin and 2.0 of the original B coin or 1.0 of the original A coin and 1.5 of the B coin or any fraction inbetween.  So.... I think my conclusion, is while you can \"track\" coins when the addresses they are transferred from and to have singular (few) transactions, that when an holder of bitcoin used a single address to receive / send coins from many many parties - then it is not implicitly possible to say that specific coin originated from A is currently those specific elements and not another part of the balance (that existed in the inputs and outputs upto the timestamp at that point) is now at this other point in time distributed at these explicit addresses... is that correct? Not that I am sure this particularly matters as that is how banks / electronic fiat works as well.  Coins are only uniqiue in so far as they can only contribute to the balance at one public address at any one point in time.  Is that sort of right?\n\nThanks","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514863652,"depth":6,"comments":""}]},{"body":"Bitcoins are not fragmented.  You have everything you need.

Bitcoin needs to scale exponentially, which is complicated by the fact that blockchains are horrible at scaling while maintaining their distributed nature. \n\nI suspect once Lightening Network matures and bitcoin has instant, cheap transactions, and micro-transactions are finally a reality, the selling points for most alts will disappear and their speculative value will plummet. \n\nCheck out the LN project when you have time.

The news spread like a wild fire on twitter. Hours later people translated the actual speech and it turned out to be \"eliminate usage of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin in criminal use cases.\" Infact, Indian crypto users got tax notices two weeks ago indicating India's plan to tax and regulate the crypto space.\n\nDeFUDing Tether: There is fear that tether has no usd to back it's 2.3 billion coins in circulation and there is evidence that suggests this may be the case. However there is no way to know anytime soon. All crypto currencies besides tether are essentially not backed by any assets and rely on customer demand to establish a price. Crypto price depends on several factors like useful functionality, popularity and future prospects. Tether is very useful because it allows users to easily transfer fiat (substitute) between exchanges without having to pay for wire transfers and wait several days. It's also very popular because of this. Even if there was no FIAT in the bank (their pre audit in september had nearly half a billion in 3 banks) the crypto market could still valuate tether as worth $1 USD sans fiat and it would be valid under their Terms of Service and not necessarily against the law. Even if some agency was to invalidate tether (would be very hard) it would still not affect the market much because it's less than 1% of the entire market share. Some other things that relieve the FUDs: subpoena against tether came in December following the reported tether hack (as you would expect) not this week as fake news bloomberg reported, Bitfinx/Tether rep actually offered another bloomberg reporter to look at all their accounts in multiple banks if they sign a non disclosure, however the reported declined but reported this fact. Additionally, respected whaleclub.io member claims he has seen proof of Tether's fiat filled bank accounts and invites any non believers to come talk to him in whale club team chat.\n\nBased on the way we stayed at 10k for a long time despite weeks of fud and because of recent Soros revelations of bitcoin being used for government corruption nest eggs I am guessing that BTC will bounce back fairly well after the panic settles a bit.","ups":3,"downs":0,"score":3,"created":1517589139,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"It's a false argument to say that tether less than 1% market share therefore it isn't important.

We're more tech-savvy than most, and indeed \"A\" and \"B\" are all pretty much nerds or very smart investors.  Price goes up faster and faster and faster, and media catches on.\n\n\"C\" investors like your cousin or coworker start to get interested. And \"C\" dwarfs \"A\" and \"B\" in size. Banks and rich investors buy in but don't tell anyone they are doing so. \"C\" investors see a chance to get rich as the price skyrockets. Now it's all over the news, Big Bang Theory, social media - everyone at least has heard of it.  Futures start trading, bringing HUGE money in.  The price goes vertical and soars.\n\nBut you can't go vertical forever, so it literally cannot stay up - it has to come down at some point.  This was the 10K-&gt;20K-&gt;15K part. \"D\" investors start to buy the post-20K dip and do really well in the short term recovery.  Meanwhile, big money is selling little bits at a time, with BTC being held by an increasingly large number of average Joes.\n\nThen something happens. Some FUD, some real news, whatever. It causes a decent drop. Most people don't care, but those \"D\"s? They just got in so all they've seen is the price go up a bit and then right back down.  \"This is stupid, it doesn't stay up!\". So \"D\"s sell. The price falls.\n\nEventually the price gets to where the \"C\"s bought in.  And now they are the ones getting a bit scared. So they start to sell. \n\nAnd you can see how it plays out from there. Every drop moves more people from the \"HODL\" bucket to the \"Shit I'm bailing!\" bucket.  It then cascades downward. And that's where we are right now.\n\nSorry for the length but hopefully it's easy to understand. Note that I didn't detail any specific news that causes the \"D\"s to sell. That news doesn't matter to anyone else. But the falling price? That becomes the \"news\" that the \"C\"s worry about.

The US government also has the ability to control demand directly by adjusting tax rates and fees that are only payable in US dollars, and by issuing payments to personnel and suppliers in USD.

The difference is called the MACD line. In a sense, this is like a taking the first derivative. Then, another moving average of the MACD line is taken, this one is called the signal line. \n\nA moving average of the MACD line is taken (i.e. 9 periods) and we call this the signal line. \n\nUsually, we plot the difference between the MACD line and the signal line as a histogram. This is sort of like taking the derivative of the MACD. \n\nSo if we were to think of the market price as the position of an object, the MACD line would be related to the object's velocity, the histogram would be related to the object's acceleration. \n\nWhen you want to swing trade, you want to buy when the price is at a low point. The low point happens when the \"velocity\" (MACD) is going from negative to positive. However, because the moving averages are taken only with past data (don't know the future data), the \"velocity\" and \"acceleration\" are delayed. So by the time you know your velocity is changing, you've already missed the low point (usually by quite a bit). \n\nSo lets say we look at the \"acceleration\" plot (histogram) instead. When it crosses from negative to positive, that means that the velocity is increasing (that doesn't mean the velocity is positive, it just means it's getting less negative). So the histogram lets us know a bit sooner when the low point is happening. Even then though, you usually still miss the lowest point. However, although you missed the lowest point, you have pretty high confidence that you'll be buying at a pretty good point (but it's the price you pay for the added confidence in your trade). \n\nAs for divergence... the MACD and RSI are measures of momentum, but they tend to follow the same shapes as the price. If you look at two separate recent dips and you see the most recent dip is lower than the one before, but you see something different in the MACD line and RSI (i.e. the most recent dip is higher then the one before), it can be a sign that the price has dipped more than it really should have, so it might be a good time to buy, it has a pretty decent chance of going up. This scenario is called a bullish divergence. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/xilPZgm.png","ups":2,"downs":0,"score":2,"created":1518490248,"depth":4,"comments":""}]}]}]}]},{"body":"At the end of the weekend/Monday morning, I reckon we’ll see a drop to 6500.

By taking these actions on the actual cash market (your exchange), these people move the price of the two markets closer. This keeps going until the prices are virtually the same, since there is no risk money to be earned as long as there remains a difference in price.  \nSo because of C&amp;C and RC&amp;C, the cash vs. future prices can only differ by a tiny fraction.  That fraction actually corresponds to the cost of financing, over the time period that separates the day of arbitrage from the settlement day of the future.

Whereas before the general mood towards crypto was very positive, now people are licking their wounds and behaving more cautiously. This means, on aggregate, that investors are (i) less likely to invest when they see positive news / movements in the price, and (ii) more likely to sell when things start to dip. Everyone is on edge, and for many these small upswings in price are simply a way for them to recover some of the losses they have incurred. This is not a mood conducive to long term upwards growth (i.e. a bull market). You have to remember that so many new people have got into crypto on the basis that they might 'get rich quick'; they couldn't care less about the technology or its long term success, and are losing interest now that the hype is gone.\n\n(b) There have been a number of recent problems with certain exchanges that are shaking peoples' faith in the security of their investments. BitGrail has just turned out to be a massive scam, Binance has been having issues, and there was an exchange (can't remember the name) just the other day that was hacked. This adds to the general sense of fear (cf. optimism) that, I believe, the market is feeling.\n\nI think the key point is that many of the new investors who entered the crypto market in Dec, who were largely responsible for the massive increase in BTC's price, have been badly burned by their experiences. Without that influx of new cash the prices of many of these coins are simply unsustainable, and it is going to take time for the market to bottom out.","ups":4,"downs":0,"score":4,"created":1518371312,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"Good explanation of speculator psychology!\n\nBesides traders who actually experienced a massive bubble firsthand (e.g. dot com bubble), most folks are not mentally prepared for how nasty the ensuing bear market can become.\n\nMarkets tend to swing from one emotional extreme(greed) to another(fear), exhibiting some symmetry - the greedier it was, the more fearful it becomes later.","ups":2,"downs":0,"score":2,"created":1518374649,"depth":1,"comments":""},{"body":"You could well be right, how long do you think it will take?

So you've spent 10 million and raised the price $200.  This would be noticed, but probably wouldn't greatly affect the market.

And boy did we go downhill from there.....\n\nIt took us hitting rock bottom, waking up in 6k's dirty bed of despair, with FUD on our face, smelling like broken dreams, regret, and bear shit, to finally take a look in the mirror and say \"I've had enough, and I refuse to sink.

We know our future is bright and our destiny is so much bigger than her and her halfway house. We are the ALPHA COIN. And if necessary we will kick in the door.

Each wallet is exactly one address. Wallet and address are two words for the same thing. I think you might be confounding exchange accounts with bitcoin wallets. Exchanges might indeed give you several addresses for transactions with your account.\n\nSo yes, nobody really knows which of the early addresses (wallets) belong to Satoshi, but odds are high that most of the very first addresses which were never moved do belong to him (or other early adopters who lost their keys...).\n\n&gt; one can trace the movement of a bitcoin (or parts of it?) since it was generated on the blockchain network\n\nThis is true. As a matter of fact, you can build a precise graph of every single fraction of a bitcoin from the beginning to now. The graph would have nodes (wallets) and transactions (arrows). \n\nImagine you receive 0.5 BTC in your wallet (address), then you send 0.2 BTC to one address and 0.1 BTC to another address. In the graph this would be one arrow going into your node and two arrows out of your node. The complete BTC transaction history can be drawn like this.\n\nSo anonymity in BTC is not very strong. As soon as someone (police investigators etc.) can establish that a certain address (wallet) is yours, they can trace all your transactions to and from other wallets. Example: the police discovers that you own address xyz because you payed a pizza with that wallet and they analyzed the pizza shop's transaction history where your name and address is pegged to that transaction because of delivery. They also know that a well-known drug dealer owns address zxy. If there is a transaction of 2.5 BTC from xyz to zxy in the blockchain, then they know you sent money to the drug dealer. Hope you never did that, because this information is there now, and will be there forever. \n\n&gt; each satoshi has something like a serial number\n\nNo. There is no such thing as single satoshis. If you receive 0.2 BTC and then 0.4 BTC, you will have 0.6 BTC in your wallet, and if you then send 0.1 BTC, there is no way to tell if those 0.1 came from the 0.2 or from the other 0.4, just like in a bank account. There are no coins, just wallets and balances.\n \n&gt; sending BTC to wrong addresses \n\nyou can't send BTC to any random number, but if you do send BTC to the wrong address, then it's gone for good, yes.

That's slightly stronger anonymity, but it still breaks often (f.e. whoever gave you your coins might know all the addresses you received coins from them in)\n\nIf you receive 0.2BTC in one tx and then 0.4BTC in another, and then spend 0.1BTC, it is possible to see which of the two outputs were spent.\n\nYou can send BTC to a 'wrong' address for which no one knows the private key - it was not lost if no one had it to begin with.

Capitulation involves extremely high volume and sharp declines. It also usually involves panic selling. The term is a derived from a military term which refers to surrender.\nBREAKING DOWN 'Capitulation' After capitulation selling, many traders think there are bargain buying opportunities. The belief is that everyone who wants to sell a stock for any reason, including forced selling due to margin calls, has already sold. The price should then, theoretically, reverse or bounce off the lows. In other words, some investors believe that capitulation is the sign of a bottom.\nInvestors can only identify capitulations after they have occurred. While traders often attempt to anticipate capitulation selling or buying, the reality is that capitulations are outcomes that result from the maximum psychological and financial pain that can be endured by investors before liquidating their positions. (To learn more, see: Profiting From Panic Selling.)\nUsing Technical Analysis to Identify Capitulations Capitulations often signal major turning points in the price action of underlying securities and financial instruments. Technical analysts can visually identify capitulation using candlestick charts. Hammer candles often form at the end of a selling frenzy when the lowest price is made, as capitulation sets in and signals a price bottom followed by a reversal bounce on heavy volume. Traders who wanted to sell their positions have done so as panic reached a climax. As fear starts to subside, greed may set in and reverse prices.\nRead more: Capitulation Definition | Investopedia [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitulation.asp#ixzz57mC5w98n](http://crypto-calendars.com/) Follow us: Investopedia on Facebook","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1519286205,"depth":0,"comments":""},{"body":"Question: at what amount of cash or BTC does it make sense to daytrade? 50 USD worth of BTC at a 1% gain would net you 50 cents.

To get back at 20.000, you need the same hype as in december: normal people stepping in, everyone talking about bitcoin. Secondly, the people that were holding must stay in.\n\nThis will not happen, this even might not happen this whole year, cause mainstream society got burnt so hard in december, they might never come back. And you need them, you need the mainstream now to lift up the price. We've come to a point that you need the normal guys to step in, cause bitcoin needs constant inflow of new money to rise. The market will bleed to death if there aren't enough newcomers. But it's way easier to bring in new people and raise the price when only 10 people put money in than when millions of people put money in. Also, the chance that 10 people will hold is way higher than a million people holding. So right now, the cryptomarket seems to be bleeding to death.

Then they'll have to create a 10-step crypto price predicting guide that they will want to sell you for $10.99!! It's like calm the HELL down; puff...puff...pass would you please!!! We don't even know what to call them to be quite honest. Are the currencies, digital assets, commodities, etc. The truth of the matter is that this blockchain evolution is in its infancy. The crypto markets are, at the moment, swarmed with your average retail investor, most of whom are pump-n-dump day-traders taking advantage of immediate gains. IMHO, we will not be able to obtain accurate price predictions for any crypto until we get mainstream adoption via your institutional investors (i.e. hedge funds, corporations, FIs, central banks, etc.) on board. However, these institutional investors won't enter until the markets mature via more common sense regulatory oversight/compliance and institutional-grade hedging/custody instruments are in place to help mitigate and offset the volatility brought on by the vicious cycles of constant day-trading. Until we get this volatility under control estimating prices is a moot action. The best predictions we can possibly make before the aforementioned occurs is by doing our due-diligence when it comes to our crypto investments by asking a few simple questions:  \n\n1. Is it solving a problem or have a realistically defined use-case?\n2. Can it deliver on solving that \"problem\" or \"use-case\"?\n3. Can it solve such-said problem better, faster, more economical, than what currently exists? \n4. What is the competition doing?\n5. Is anybody actually using/trialing such-said blockchain tech?\n6. Who's behind the tech (i.e. leadership, engineers, institutional players, etc.).\n7. Does the leadership have a \"defined\" vision for their respective blockchain technology?\n8. Is the leadership transparent and above-board (i.e. providing communication, progress reports, etc.)?\n9. Is such-said crypto company/foundation abiding by or working with the regulatory community to ensure a smooth transition (by far one of the most important question)? \n10.

To get out any funds, another transaction has to be broadcast and verified, while the transaction recorder on-chain will simply state the totals - however if something shady were to be able to happen between the two on-chain transactions, the final totals wouldn't match the funds that were previously deposited, broadcast, and verified, rejecting the entire transaction altogether. This way there in an inherent incentive to just NOT even try to double spend, even if it were possible, since the funds would just stay locked up in the channel. It is a layer 2 solution, not a parallel system, so everything that happens is dictated by the rules of layer 1. But I might have some details wrong, I am still a noob.","ups":2,"downs":0,"score":2,"created":1519631673,"depth":1,"comments":[{"body":"&gt; This way there in an inherent incentive to just NOT even try to double spend, even if it were possible, since the funds would just stay locked up in the channel.\n\nIf both parties to a channel are 'colluding to cheat', they don't need to open a payment channel and can't do anything the layer 1 blockchain won't allow them to do anyway.\n\nIf one party is trying to cheat inside the channel, the other party can always close the channel on the last valid state (the channel isn't opened until there is an initial valid state), so their funds are never locked up for long.\n\nCheating by broadcasting the wrong state to the blockchain leads to loss of all your funds for that channel (they'll be swept by your counterparty). Misbehaving inside the channel will result in the counterparty closing it, and you get 'refunded' whatever you had before in the last valid state.","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1519656282,"depth":2,"comments":""},{"body":"Andreas Antonopolous has claimed that going from BTC to LN will be like flipping a switch on your wallet.

But that requires the recipient to participate (as if you send an atomic swap to him - he'll need to accept a hash preimage to take the funds), or multiple transactions (in which case you might as well close a channel to pay and open a new one).\n\nThere are blockchains that don't exhibit this property - Monero has a ledger of all transactions, right? But you can't check an address and see how much there is in it.\n\nI think the blockchain's basic property is not storing transactions or proving the absence of them, but allowing to verify that a transaction is valid and confirming it. The blockchain verifies LN's opening and closing transactions, and inside the channel both peers agree on every state update.

Look, when people invest in the stocks of a serious company, there is something solid there, share prices and dividends pour in when the company produces goods and services that people are keen to pay for.

So how do we get enough incoming greedy suckers (what some people here call \"new money\")?   \n\n\nSaid suckers can come in on their own, e.g after hearing wild stories if new mansions and lambos, or they must be encouraged.   The encouragement might be in the form of extensive hype in all sorts of media, or it might have to be more robust (e.g. pumping).    Key point to keep in mind is that the pumpers and the suckers are actually in agreement: that is, it is a dubious activity, but we'll make our money and pass it on.\n\nSo, to answer your question, \"happy\" is not the word I would use, but I am OK with it; it;s how these crypto things work.    Nobody will make any money unless some clueless types keep coming in.   Should I be sensitive about the clueless types?  Not really.  Other than than the obvious warning signs, regulators, banks, governments etc. keep warning them, but they won't stop.

This means that all of the new changes were hardcoded in and the old exe was discarded. Can I think of Bitcoin like this? If an update or implementation is needed Bitcoin will have to \"hardfork\" into a new project and build on to the code or else it will have to have developments done in cooperation with the core bitcoin code?

This reduces the security and resilience of the network and makes it more prone to manipulation/tampering. This is a sliding scale, however, and in the long term block size increases will probably have to happen. \n\nIn the near term, the plan is to get a 'layer 2' instant payment upgrade rolled out ('Ligntning') and get the exchanges and wallets to support SegWit, which is an optimization of the block contents that allows more transactions in a given block without increasing its size. These will allow for a very substantial improvement in on-chain transaction cost reduction and practically free off-chain transactions for instant retail payments (the kind of thing you'd do on a typical credit card, Apple Pay, Android Pay, or what have you). \n\nOnce those happen (Lightning is moved from 'beta' to production nodes connected to mainnet and SegWit is everywhere) we will have a better view of how much the block size *must* be increased to support demand for on-chain transactions.

Ideally, we'd like every person to run a full node on an appliance in their home so ownership of the network would be as widely distributed as possible, across many individuals in different geographies with different electricity and Internet providers, in different jurisdictions (different governments), different political views and party affiliations, different religions, different languages, etc. \n\nThe network needs to be extremely large and owned/operated by the most diverse sample of the population possible.

At least have the intellectual honesty to state it is your own conspiracy theory, rather than just state things like they are facts when there is no back-up.  The truth is Tether is no different than any other alt coin or bitcoin for that matter.  Even if they DIDN'T back up each tether with traditional currency, it still has the value it has because others have bought into it.  Those that use it don't expect to go and trade it in for USD.  They would convert to BTC and then to USD like any other alt coin.  These people understand the way it works, and are ok with it's value being tethered to the dollar.

Except the creator probably isn't Japanese, nobody knows really. Also proof-of-work isn't very complicated (depending), its essentially solving the problem of sha256\\^2(block-header) &lt; target, see https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_work\n\n&gt; So the system starts documenting the code from inception everywhere it goes so it's always accountable for and the blockchain system makes this visible to everyone at all times only showing the amount to everyone else not the code which only you know? And every time you spend or send that Bitcoin to somebody else you give them your code which represents it in the system and the system either creates a new code to represent that amount of Bitcoin or adds on to the code once the other person receives it. So you no longer know it and can't access the Bitcoin anymore.\n\nYes so the blockchain contains all transactions that ever happened. Transactions work with digital signatures, so every coin can only be spent if a valid digital signature is produced which only someone who knows the private key of that coin can create. Every fully-verifying wallet checks that every digital signature and other rules are valid, otherwise it won't accept the bitcoin transaction as genuine. So in other words every fully-verifying wallet checks all the rules, and one of those rules is that only miners can create coins out of nothing and only following a [strict schedule.](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply)\n","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1517137767,"depth":3,"comments":[{"body":"[deleted]","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1517139149,"depth":4,"comments":[{"body":"&gt;So you're saying minors make 12.5 BTC in 10 minutes? Isn't just one BTC like $12000 right now?\n\nRight.\n\nThe miners take a bunch of Bitcoin transactions, bundle them up into a list, attach one to the front of the list that says \"pay 12.5 BTC to my mining address, which didn't exist before this block\", and then toss in a random number (the \"nonce\") and hash the entire thing with the SHA-256 algorithm, twice. If the end result starts with enough 0s (which you can't tell whether it will or it won't without actually trying it) then the block is \"valid\" and they show it to all other miners, who accept it and start trying to build on top of it. If it doesn't start with enough 0s, they add one to the nonce value, and try again. They do this trillions of times per second, basically just guess-and-checking over and over and over. If they get lucky, they get to keep that 12.5 BTC from that one transaction that pays themselves (out of thin air), which is called \"the coinbase transaction\" and it's the only type of transaction that allows bitcoins to be created from nothing. If they tried to make more than 12.5 BTC (or whatever the current \"coinbase\" value happens to be, since it divides in half every four years) then the whole block is invalid and the rest of the network ignores it completely.\n\n&gt;is a bitcoin it self a code or file that actually gets sent between computers and wallets \n\nNo, not really. A bitcoin is an abstract concept. There's no \"file\" that gets sent like what you're imagining. Instead, every single bitcoin comes from a coinbase transaction (meaning that at some point, a miner created it out of thin air via the process described above), and whoever has control of the *private key* which can issue a valid *signature* for the *address* that the coinbase transaction went to, is allowed to \"send\" those coins to any other address with such a signature. There is no \"file\" that moves, but the *available balance* from the first (sending) address gets subtracted from, while the balance of the second (receiving) address gets added to. From then on, the receiver can \"send\" the coins using the same technique (authorizing the send to a new address with a valid signature from their own).\n\nIt's a big ledger (database) of balances, which everyone running a \"Bitcoin node\" is keeping track of. Whenever a new block is added to the chain (by a lucky miner producing it), every node updates its ledger/database to make sure the balances are changed accordingly.\n\nSo the \"coins\" don't actually get \"sent\" like files do when you attach them to an email. Instead, addresses have their balances subtracted from or added to, and we conceptualize or visualize it as \"coins being sent\" because that is easier to understand and imagine.","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1517151426,"depth":5,"comments":""}]}]}]}]}]},{"body":"Sorry noobish question.

Even with Bitcoin's new Lightning Network it still cannot deliver the speed and scalability of other coins.  There is a huge misunderstanding that unlimited scaling will solve all Bitcoin's problems. Because every open/close of an LN channel means an expansion in transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, causing the bottleneck shifts from a limit on the transactions that can be processed on-chain to a bottleneck on how many payment channels can be opened or closed at any given time. It's important to remember that Lightning doesn't allow instant settlement of funds. That means that you can't spend lightning funds until the lightning channel has been closed and the final state transmitted to the blockchain. Effectively what lightning does is allow a massive increase in the capacity for changing ownership of BTC but the BTC doesn't \"move\" until the channel closes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","ups":2,"downs":0,"score":2,"created":1517390249,"depth":1,"comments":""}]},{"body":"makes me wish i had more funds in my gdax. i would buy more in right now.","ups":4,"downs":0,"score":4,"created":1517389637,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"We've now had 4 or 5 HUGE dips.

No doubt the blockchain technology that gave rise to Bitcoin has ushered in a whole new industry around digital securities/assets allowing the transfer of digital property/value, such that the transfer is guaranteed to be safe and secure. However, with that being said, there are superior blockchain technologies out there that can do this far better than Bitcoin. Due to scalability issues, expensive fees (more than any bank I've ever been affiliated with), and a lack of consensus among miners yielding fork after fork, Bitcoin has created a veil of instability and unpredictability around it, making industries/corporations/retailers, at-large, wary to utilize/accept it as a payment option.

However, despite the fact that your coinbase account will display \"wallets\", and technically they are \"wallets\", that is not what we generally mean by the term, as in this case, the exchange is in charge of storing the coins and private keys. Even though Coinbase or other exchanges may promise to hold most of its reserves in cold (offline) storage, they cannot guarantee the safety or that they won't one day go poof and disappear with all of your digital wealth. If you do not own and have control over your own private keys, they are not your coins and **nobody** will help you if something happens to the exchange, eg. a big hack or bankruptcy . You should be using at least a wallet like [Electrum](https://electrum.org/#home) for smaller amounts or a ideally, a hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor for real amounts.

Also the comment of the head of the Central Bank is made with an eye on the \"roller coaster\" of the bitcoin course, which in the beginning of the year fell by half after take-off to record highs near $ 20 thousand in December.\n\nCarney pointed to \"extreme volatility,\" which, he says, indicates that there is no intrinsic value or external support. According to his calculations, the average volatility of the largest 10 virtual coins by market capitalization was more than 25 times higher than the average volatility of American stocks in 2017.\n\nIn his speech, the head of the Bank of England voiced the potentially useful properties of blockade technology, which underlies bitcoin, but noted that digital currencies in themselves failed the task of winning the status of real money.

After that it may well bounce back at over 13K, who knows. The volumes are very low right now which isn't a great sign for bullish trends.\n\nI acknowledge the possibility that I might be wrong, but my point is: take your time and see where the price is heading. Don't let fear of missing out (FOMO) cloud your judgement. It's usually safe to wait a little to see trends emerge over a few days' time.\n\nOne possibility is to buy a small amount right now and see how that goes. Once you have a small BTC balance this will help you to learn about how to best send and store it safely. Also, you will learn more about the market once you have dipped your toes into the water and have a stake in the game.\n\nI recently bought a Trezor and a Ledger Nano S hardware wallet and they have made trading so much easier, can warmly recommend both of them for increased security. If you wish to expand your portfolio to other cryptocurrencies at some point, hardware wallets will aid you greatly.

It can be caused by several different things. It can be like AMZN in the last 5 years, where the price growth is mirrored by revenue or profit growth. It can be like a penny stock that was pumped by insiders to be dumped later. Or it can be like the 2007 housing market in which people bid up real estate prices without fear because prices \"always\" rose. The 3rd example is the only one that is referred to as a bubble, since a bubble is characterized by a specific set of attributes and a specific pattern of events.  \n\nIn short, they go through stages - from discovery, to growing popularity, to mania, to profit-taking, and finally to collapse.  The price growth really takes off as mainstream media attention begins - everyone seems to want in. They start to worry about missing out, so they pay higher and higher prices, believing that they can't lose. The entire population has the opportunity to participate, although not all will. \n\nEventually however the growth must reverse, and once it does it shakes the faith of almost every investor.  At that point all it takes is a nudge - a regulation, or maybe... a cryptocurrency exchange being compromised to make the entire thing implode.\n\nYou can see how the current day Bitcoin has gone through the stages, but the 2014 version did not.  In 2014 the potential investor pool was much smaller, since the average person had never heard of it. The price soared, but it was limited by the amount of money coming in. Popularity was still growing but it hadn't yet reached critical mass.  I'd argue that this was actually a very early step in a multi-year bubble that is ongoing.\n\nI believe that 2014's price increase was more akin to a penny stock's increase where insiders behave unscrupulously.\n\nhttps://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/study-late-2013-bitcoin-bubble-fueled-suspicious-trading-activity-mt-gox/\n\nPrice manipulation comes as no surprise to me - nothing is regulated, and Bitcoin is strictly limited in quantity. It's the perfect storm!  Every pump has its dump of course, and the price came back down from $1000. Some investors got pissed, some angry, others hung on.  The fact that Bitcoin had no real media attention became a positive. There were still millions of people out there who didn't have a negative perception of Bitcoin! And so popularity continued to rise to get us to where we are today.  \n\nToday, most people have heard of Bitcoin, and most people only remember the last 1 or 2 things they've heard about something.  A crash now won't make people less excited about Bitcoin, or make people not trust Bitcoin - it'll make them actively hate Bitcoin.  So the price will bottom and start to recover somewhere down the road. But it won't be like 2014 - the bitter taste of Bitcoin will linger longer this time around.\n\nOk, I need to get to bed. I'll comment on the article tomorrow. And note that this is only my personal opinion. It's educated but I might be 100% wrong.","ups":2,"downs":0,"score":2,"created":1520611448,"depth":3,"comments":""}]},{"body":"Nope, there are still humans in the market!","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1520526297,"depth":2,"comments":""},{"body":"Mt.Gox is still fucking us over though ","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1520521766,"depth":2,"comments":[{"body":"If Mt.Gox sell all of his bitcoin (which is 1.9B$ at this moment), the price will crash to 1k$ for sure.

The rise in December was the breaking point for most of the financial sector. They finally \"got it\" and they have poured in. What does that mean? It means we have hundreds, if not 1000s of hedge fund managers in this now, people who are extremely risk adverse and who control significant amounts of capital (i.e. they can make the market move). They buy BTC at $9k and they sell at $11k. If they control just a 1000 BTC (which is EXTREMELY conservative) they just made $2MM for their clients. Why the hell would they HODL?!? They are fine with playing that $2k gap from here until the market gets big enough that most of them can't move it anymore (i.e. that's when it gets into the tens of trillions). BTC is not going to $20k this year, in fact I'd be surprised if it hits $15k. If you HODL in the market how it is now you're better off just unfollowing groups like this, putting your BTC and whatever else coins you have on some offline hardware and coming back in 10 years.

I'm not saying you shouldn't throw some $'s into this coin or that coin on dips and keep building, but the cold hard truth, just like in the tech boom, is that most of these coins aren't going to make it, and (spoiler alert) BTC probably won't either.

Find something you like to do and instead of gambling with your hard earned money, invest it in your business.  I started a small business with just $256.  I found something I thought might be a good seller and then went on ebay, Amazon and other sites to see how these items sell.  I then used the $256 to buy a small amount of these items.  They sold out in a week and I knew I had something.  I did not quit my job but continued working as I built my business.  I hit $100k in sales after three years and now 7 years after I started, I average between $175k and $200k per year.  I am the only \"employee\" and the business has decent profit margins.  There are no guarantees in life but you can do research that will better your chances of success (in my case it was seeing what kind of volume others are achieving, what keywords they were using, which products sold best for them and what types of advertisements worked for them).  I do not rest on my laurels and am constantly working to grow my business.  I also pick up some rideshare gigs when not working the business.  I play with crypto for fun but will never \"invest\" in anything more than I would in a night at a casino.  There are too many unknowns for me.  I would rather trade within a range for a 10-25% profit.  You only need to be successful a few times to double your money.  But the money you put in should be play money.  One country puts restrictions on crypto and the whole market falls 20%.  Another exchange goes down and who knows where it goes.  You say you are highly educated - use that to your advantage.  And definitely do not discount the value of hard work, even if it means multiple jobs.  My grandfather came to this country WITHOUT an education.  He served in WWII and came back to New York and took a low level job in the transit system.  He then took on a second full time job as a porter in a NYC hotel.  While he was away from home alot, he was soon able to buy a house in NY and to eventually retire comfortably.  He is now gone but his old home recently sold for $750,000.  It can be done but you need to put in the time and make sacrifices.  Whether you take my advice or not, I hope you find the success you are seeking.

This time Kobayashi hasn't sold off anything, and as far as we know the Mt Gox debt is more or less paid off.\n\nhttps://coinstelegram.com/2018/03/10/the-next-court-proceeding-for-mt-gox-bankruptsy-is-postponed-until-september-2018/\n\n(Credit to FlorianManner for posting the link here)\n\nWhile the price of Bitcoin is still affected by fears from the recent crash, combined with fears of near future drops, I personally doubt to see a drop below $8000 at this point in time. At the moment a lot of potential buyers naturally want to wait and see where the final bottom occurs, which reduces the demand presently.\n\nOn the other hand of the spectrum we have bitcoin miners and potential sellers that expect a rise towards 10-11k levels within a week or the coming week. Considering the recent crash and the fears in the market they might have to settle for 9.5k presently even though they consider 10k+ to be a reasonable market price in a market that isn't affected by strong fears.\n\nThe question is then how low the sellers and miners are willing to go below their expected sale price. On the one hand, if they wait, the prices will eventually recover from the crash. On the other hand, if they need cash right away they might sell now if they fear a further drop.\n\nIf the market sellers expects a return to 10-11k levels within a foreseeable future, then every thousand dollars below this line is considered a substantial loss of potential revenue. This is why I don't expect to see prices below 8k at the moment; it may happen as a quick visit from sellers that need urgent cash, but a few exceptions won't dictate the price for long.\n\nThis is why I think that predictions of a price below 5.8k is wishful thinking: yes, I would love such low prices to accumulate more BTC, but I don't think there would be enough sellers that would consider that price range to be beneficial. Since 11k is a definite possibility in the coming weeks, only a fool would sell below the worst crash bitcoin has seen, from which it has recovered remarkably since then. Further drops may happen, but the question is how likely a particular drop is compared to expected sale prices.","ups":2,"downs":0,"score":2,"created":1520792353,"depth":0,"comments":""},{"body":"https://coinstelegram.com/2018/03/10/the-next-court-proceeding-for-mt-gox-bankruptsy-is-postponed-until-september-2018/","ups":4,"downs":0,"score":4,"created":1520786539,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"Good news indeed, the last Mt Gox BTC dump now for a while, lets see where the market moves now.","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1520792557,"depth":1,"comments":""},{"body":"thats all we needed right? i think we can moon finally","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1520791023,"depth":1,"comments":[{"body":"A slow steady rise over time is better in my opinion, but hey, we all enjoy the weekend and the recent Mt Gox news and I think the worst bumps of the year are over.

I only listened to everyone preach HODL.\n\nI ended up selling all my BTC at the all-time low because I didn't know anything about trading and had no strategy at all. I was watching BTC drop like a rock and thought it would hit 3k again so I panic sold using coinbase. My mindset at the time was I didn’t want to completely lose everything so I was essentially cutting my losses. My money was then locked in transaction for a week while I watched the price rise again. Selling at 6k was the worse crypto decision I have ever made, but that’s also because I was completely ignorant and delusional. After making that mistake I told myself that if I were to continue staying invested in this technology, I’d have to educate myself better. I now understand the technology better, graphs, trading strategies, market manipulation and bot trading (although I don’t personally bot trade). I feel way more confident and have slowly regained half of my BTC losses over the last month. Its hasn’t been easy but it is possible. Although this is kind of contradicting in the sense that I shouldn’t have sold at 6k, it was also a blessing in disguise because the HODL mindset is what got me in that mess in the first place. \n\nI have believed in bitcoin for a long time and continued to do so even after losing money. I will continue believing even if the market completely crashes as I feel that the technology is far too superior to just flat out fail.  To me, BTC is the way of the future and quite frankly it’s just flat out fuckn awesome. Plus I love the community that comes with it. \n\nNone of us know what the future will bring but for heaven sakes people, the days of holding and hoping for the best are over. There is way too much money and manipulation going on in this market now. Holding and dreaming about lambos in space isn’t the best decision. There are better strategies. You have to adapt. I’m not saying trading is superior to holding, I’m simply saying that having a firm decision to only hold no matter what is a horrible decision and misinforms people. I was once one of those people and held all the way till the end until I was no longer willing to lose it all. \n\nWhile I completely agree that day trading BTC is nearly impossible unless you happen to luck out or stare at a screen all day, there are still beneficial strategies to weekly trading or even more long-term trading.

I don't gamble, but a lot of my good friends do.  Gambling is a scam that is specifically meant to part people from their money.  Why aren't you trolling gambling forums?  It's certainly a much bigger industry?  My view is that they're adults, and if they want to spend their money that way, so be it.  They're not hurting me.  Don't you think people having the freedom to spend the fruits of their productive labor where they see fit something that we should strive for?\n\n&gt;  Ever get angry when you see the few exploit the many, ruin the planet for profit and steal the future from the next generation?\n\nSure.  It is because of that that bitcoin was invented.  To be able to take away the power of people who do the things you're talking about.  Why aren't you protesting against ExxonMobil?  Or any large car manufacturer for that matter.  Surely you recognize that the effects on the planet of these companies is far greater than anything bitcoin has to do with.  Don't you think it's just a little bit weird that you'll create sockpuppet accounts in order to troll a subreddit that you have no interest in?\n\n&gt; If nobody shares an opposing opinion than how can anyone honestly make an informed decision of their own?\n\nIs that what you feel you're providing?  An informed decision?  Don't you think you'd need to at least understand the subject in order to be 'informed'?  You don't even know what the invention is, or indeed, why it works.  I recommend that no-one at all invest in bitcoin if they don't understand what its value proposition is, and more importantly, how it is going to be be realized.\n\nBut you're not doing that.  You're like a christian trolling an atheist subreddit, and calling everyone idiots because they don't believe in creationism.  You're not providing any insights into bitcoin.  You're certainly not helping anyone.  It sounds to me like you're trying to troll this subreddit in some bizarre belief that someone here is going to attempt to change your mind, *and you're not gonna let that happen goddamit*.  Why would I do that?  I don't care what you think.  Don't like bitcoin?  Don't invest in it.  It's not that hard of a concept to grasp.  No-one is holding a gun to your head.","ups":2,"downs":0,"score":2,"created":1520855382,"depth":5,"comments":""}]}]}]},{"body":"exactly, How do we get this message across to moderators now?","ups":2,"downs":0,"score":2,"created":1520849739,"depth":2,"comments":""},{"body":"Nocioiners, blended by ignorance.

Things will be much better and healthy if there is huge liquidity in exchanges, real life use cases as a global decentralised transactional currency and of course if the wealth distribution is somewhat uniform. All of these can only happen if these early adopters/whales sell their Bitcoin and we small fishes eat them. Remember, in a ecosystem if there is nothing to eat for small fishes then entire thing falls! I'll be absolutely happy if all those early whales panic sell their holding over night today.

Where does that bitcoin go? Will it still be available for the user with the blockchain.info wallet, or will it be gone forever?\n\nSo far I'm planning to just tell attendees to just sweep their paper wallets and destroy them, but I heard that importing can have a benefit by allowing money to be sent to the public key, then having it immediately available on the wallet.

From rational self interest alone they are not likely to sell far below a price level they consider to be plausible.\n\nIf the market is willing to buy bitcoin at 10k, which it was recently, every $1k drop below this level is a major potential loss of revenue for miners and thus reduces their incentive to sell. As a result of hardware investments and projected ROI, miners provide some degree of stability to the price of bitcoin. If the price of bitcoin rebounds, which it generally does, the miners that can afford to wait one or a few weeks with selling have incentive to wait for better prices.\n\nWhile miners will certainly sell when they consider it profitable, adding newly mined coins to the market, they will be less inclined to sell at a price that they consider to be greatly undervalued.

During decision making, anchoring occurs when individuals use an initial piece of information to make subsequent judgments. Once an anchor is set, other judgments are made by adjusting away from that anchor, and there is a bias toward interpreting other information around the anchor. For example, the initial price offered for a used car sets the standard for the rest of the negotiations, so that prices lower than the initial price seem more reasonable even if they are still higher than what the car is really worth.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1521380541,"depth":5,"comments":[{"body":"There also Confirmation Bias to take into account.

The vote tally would define how much the site owner would need to pay per page view to keep their position. If something is voted very high and is very popular already, it would be super cheap (or sometimes just free) to keep that position because of how useful it is to people.\n\nOn the other hand, if something is voted low, the site owner would have to pay out more Bitcoin to keep their position. This pushes bad sites lower down the search results.\n\n*What about bots and fake votes?*\n\nAlong with fraud detection based on suspicious activity (same IP, same time period, unnatural clicks) the system can also have proof-of-stake weighting on votes. As a logged-in user (which isn't required either), you can prove that you own some large number of Bitcoin, and as long as the coins don't move, your votes can count a \"little\" bit more in terms of being less suspicious. It's not perfect, but it's basically harder/expensive for a fraudster to buy up a lot of Bitcoin just to fake a lot of votes. And it doesn't cost the user anything, since they are just signing the fact that they own coins. They don't pay a thing.\n\n*How will this site go from empty to full of good search results?*\n\nPeople who submit links will earn Bitcoin on valid upvotes! The rate at which you can submit more links is based on how many upvotes your past submissions received. So, you can't just spam crap into the system. You will earn a higher rate overall per upvote if you have a strong past history of high upvote content, and a lower rate for a low past history.

Reducing available ways of attack typically includes changing default passwords, the removal of unnecessary software, unnecessary usernames or logins, and the disabling or removal of unnecessary services.\n\nThere are various methods of hardening Unix and Linux systems. This may involve, among other measures, applying a patch to the kernel such as Exec Shield or PaX; closing open network ports; and setting up intrusion-detection systems, firewalls and intrusion-prevention systems.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28","ups":2,"downs":0,"score":2,"created":1521720968,"depth":4,"comments":""}]},{"body":"securing. make sure no one can log in somehow ","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1521720858,"depth":3,"comments":""}]}]}]},{"body":"Just heard info that bitcoin will be over 12k in one week.

Their automated trading behavior leads new traders in cryptomarkets to overpay for the coins they are buying. The classic “pump-and-dump” scheme that was popular in the early nineties and made famous by the Wolf of Wall Street Jordan Belfort is still being run effectively — by bots — in today’s crypto markets. This scheme involves coordinated purchases of low-priced coin to “pump” the price and attract new investors who are easily excited by the increase. As investors unknowingly buy “the pump”, bots dump the asset in near perfect coordination. With no new buyers coming into the market, the coin quickly loses value and investors are left scratching their heads — and agonizing over their wallets.\n\nUnfortunately, this scenario plays out all too often in cryptocurrency markets. As Business Insider has reported, there is no shortage of coordinated schemes where a group of traders use bots to simultaneously purchase coins to drive up price. Investors hear about the coin, get caught up in the euphoria, and buy in, hoping to make a quick profit. What they are left with is anything but.\n\nWith more and more “retail” investors joining the crypto space in recent weeks, chasing the Bitcoin boom, it’s likely even more people will be susceptible to pump-and-dump strategies.\n\n\nHow to spot a bot\nIt can be extremely hard to detect where bots are at work without advanced analysis tools. They’re easier to spot in hindsight.\nCryptocurrency markets are here to stay, and it’s likely the bots are as well — as long as the market remains unregulated. There is already a large volume of trading bots operating in the market that the vast majority of investors aren’t aware of. As investors become more savvy, so too will the bots. And so we’re likely headed down the path of an arms race. As detection tools get stronger, developers will look for ways around detection. As bots get more advanced, platforms will accelerate research and development to counterattack. With regulation seemingly right around the corner, only time will tell which side will win the fight until the government steps in to stabilize the market and put an end to predatory bots.","ups":2,"downs":0,"score":2,"created":1521907255,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"That's a great explanation, thank you. \n\nThese people doing this co-ordinating, surely it's a good idea to be part of their circle so you avoid being exploited?","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1521926638,"depth":1,"comments":""}]},{"body":"The exchanges does not hide that they manipulate the price, while everyone is looking for whales. all manipulations come from insider trading on the largest exchanges.
