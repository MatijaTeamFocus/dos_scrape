In the development map that they published on their website, they highlight that for the months of July they will integrate the Petro network with Counterparty, as we reported in our article.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regarding the modifications of the preliminary white paper with respect to the Petro network, sources close to the government told CriptoNoticias that there is an ongoing dispute over which team of developers will carry out its technological implementation; the debate, which happens in the high government, seeks to choose between a group of Venezuelans, another of Chileans and Argentines, and another of Spaniards to continue with the development.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As reported by CriptoNoticias will be issued 100 million PTR that will be divisible into 100 million units, so the minimum unit will be 0.00000001 PTR, called in the white paper as &amp;quot;Menes&amp;quot;. It was also informed about the distribution of the tokens that would be in a private pre-sale of 38.4 million PTR, a public sale of 44 million PTR and the remaining will be for the Superintendence of Cryptocurrency and Related Venezuelan Activities (SUPCACVEN).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Initially, the VIBE foundation would maintain part of the profits but this did not find correspondence in this latest version. In our article we also inform that the 55% collected in its ICO will go to the &amp;quot;Sovereign Fund&amp;quot; of the Venezuelan government for supporting the cryptoactive, as well as, the incentive system of discounts for the sale of the token.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that the white paper published by the government seems to be a non-definitive version , since it is in beta 0.9 and has been published only 20 days before the private pre-sale announced by the Venezuelan government for this February 20.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Based on this, it is likely that you will make changes before that date. Neither have details been established as to which means the private pre-sale and its ICO will be carried out , nor will any recognized exchange house accept it in its portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With the publication of this official version, the information published by CriptoNoticias about the Petro White Paper regarding the way that cryptoactives will be generated and distributed is confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "ethereum", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/ethereum/comments/7uagjf/venezuela_publishes_official_petro_white_paper/dtjifhp/", "num_reports": null, "name": "t1_dtjifhp", "created": 1517465552.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1517436752.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ethereum", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2zf9m", "approved_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_7uagjf", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dtk1fhy", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "hcorey22", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t3_7uagjf", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": " After finishing the distribution phase of the tokens, the cryptoactives would migrate to the Petro network, which would be a bifurcation of the Decred blockchain  .
