People don&amp;#39;t seem to understand why fees exist in cryptocurrencies. Even tiny fees play a pivotal role in decentralizing the system and adding security layers. There is no such thing as a free transaction, someone has to pay for it in time, cpu power and bandwidth. If XRB wants to achieve decentralization, become mainstream, and continue feeless transactions.. they will learn the costs of such a system the hard way. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For those wanting to gear up for a moon mission, being critical of your coin is ultimately how you will get there. This mission shouldn&amp;#39;t be to down vote any critical article and upvote any shill article in hopes more people will speculate on XRB. The goal needs to be to attain real use cases that push this coin to the mainstream in a way that takes decentralization AND security very seriously. If you believe in the project then push for the project to be something more, otherwise this will result in a long pump and a long dump. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7udbr4/it_seems_to_only_cost_3m_to_kill_raiblocks/dtjjacv/", "num_reports": null, "name": "t1_dtjjacv", "created": 1517466405.0, "author_flair_text": "", "created_utc": 1517437605.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/CryptoCurrency", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wlj3", "approved_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_7udbr4", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dtjob70", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Iruwen", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 4, "parent_id": "t3_7udbr4", "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Notice how there's not a single real argument against your points besides \"FUD\", \"shitpost\", \"fuck off\" and \"dyor\".

What about the full historical nodes? These are the problem in this attack. But let&amp;#39;s say pruning could be done for all nodes. Even if it takes 2 ,3, 4 years the problem remain. It would cost the attackers 2,3,4 times more money but there are BILLIONS at stake!
