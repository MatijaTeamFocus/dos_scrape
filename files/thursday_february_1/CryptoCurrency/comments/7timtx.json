JavaScript like the ones you linked to typically mine Monero or similar which has a PoW algorithm which is by design CPU intensive, and hence they hijack a large % of the users CPU. The Oyster protocol PoW is designed to use small % of the CPU and to scale back even further if there is any impact on performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ads (particularly mobile ads) eat a lot of bandwidth and CPU (many ads use JavaScript, Flash, etc. which are CPU intensive). By using the Oyster protocol, mobile data usage should be decreased (which I think we can all agree is great) and in theory battery life should not be significantly impacted (although we will need to wait for Testnet B which is released in about a month for definitive proof of this).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7timtx/weekly_skeptics_thread_january_28_2018/dte3zdk/", "num_reports": null, "name": "t1_dte3zdk", "created": 1517219307.0, "author_flair_text": "4 - 5 years account age. 250 - 500 comment karma.", "created_utc": 1517190507.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/CryptoCurrency", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wlj3", "approved_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_7timtx", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 2, "name": "t1_dte76j8", "id": "dte76j8", "parent_id": "t1_dtdlste", "depth": 2, "children": ["dte76j8"]}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dtdlste", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Bird-Man-Jr", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 11, "parent_id": "t1_dtdlakt", "score": 11, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "You do know ads can consume up to 79% of mobile data?\n\nhttps://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160317/09274333934/why-are-people-using-ad-blockers-ads-can-eat-up-to-79-mobile-data-allotments.shtml\n\nSo when PRL uses x=&lt;1% of cpu and creates an add-less interface all it will take is a little marketing.", "edited": 1517172260.0, "author_flair_css_class": "noflair", "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You do know ads can consume up to 79% of mobile data?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160317/09274333934/why-are-people-using-ad-blockers-ads-can-eat-up-to-79-mobile-data-allotments.shtml\"&gt;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160317/09274333934/why-are-people-using-ad-blockers-ads-can-eat-up-to-79-mobile-data-allotments.shtml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So when PRL uses x=&amp;lt;1% of cpu and creates an add-less interface all it will take is a little marketing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7timtx/weekly_skeptics_thread_january_28_2018/dtdlste/", "num_reports": null, "name": "t1_dtdlste", "created": 1517199031.0, "author_flair_text": "", "created_utc": 1517170231.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/CryptoCurrency", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wlj3", "approved_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_7timtx", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dte6l83", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mrcavooter", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 5, "parent_id": "t1_dtdlakt", "score": 5, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Yea and most anti-malware will quarantine that in a quick second.
