Somewhat similar to coinmarketcap, with extra useful features - eg interactive 7/30/365-day **price charts** or 24h-volume evolution (nifty tool to spot double top/bottoms). I've made some outstanding trades thanks to the 'rank-tracker' bar chart - notably by spotting rising/declining coins much earlier than i would on coinmarketcap. \n\n- **[CoinDance](https://coin.dance/stats)** bitcoin community stats - definitely the most **interesting statistics** on bitcoin that you will find (lots of cool random figures). I often use Coindance to get a quick overview of the price (over different time periods), the current **GoogleTrends search volume** for bitcoin, the community interests around bitcoin (eg i recently learned bitcoin is increasingly being using in the online dating community). Also - scroll down to the \"bitcoin engagement by gender\" - here you can see that we absolutely need to do more work as a community to include women in all areas of bitcoin. \n\n- **[Obituary stats](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats/)** - you may think I'm joking - but these stats really help me understand &amp; focus on the **importance of having a long-term strategy for holding bitcoin**. No matter how \"emotional\" you feel about bitcoin in the current moment, realize that it's mostly media reporting or FUD on social media that are influencing your feelings. Go read the obituaries back to 2010 - understand that they've all been wrong. You'll find the same **\"bitcoin is dead comments\"** by searching reddit from 2010 to 2018. Always remember that Bitcoin the technology (&amp; bitcoin the currency) has **always been very much alive**, growing, &amp; boasting an active empowered community. \n\n- **[Bitcoinity exchange rank](https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/rank/30d/USD?c=e&amp;t=ae)** - as a newcomer to bitcoin, it's best to know which exchanges are attracting the highest trading volumes. Such exchanges usually have the most users, among which professional/serious members from the community can be found. I would recommend choosing the **most appropriate high-volume exchange** for your use-case &amp; scenario (eg are you looking to do pro trading on bitfinex/gdax or are you looking to make large yet simple &amp; once-off orders on bitstamp/kraken/gemini)   \n\n- **[Tradingview](https://uk.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/)** social bitcoin stats - pro traders use this platform to **share in-depth technical analysis and debate** each-others' prognostics. What I like most about the site is the buy/sell speedometer - whereby users can show their current opinion for bitcoin. If you are all about the price of bitcoin, then tradingview has great user-generated stats, info, and discussion.  \n\n- **[Blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info/charts)** technical graphs - these are indispensable to every bitcoiner. Important charts include **block details, mining information, and network activity** - eg the mempool size (ie the amount of unconfirmed transactions) or average transaction fee. I especially like to follow the **\"hash rate\" chart** - as price has proven to be closely correlated. Blockchain was once the holy grail off online wallets, until they sacrificed their most popular features to be more \"regulator-friendly\". Nevertheless I absolutely love their graphs which are clean and easy to read/understand. \n\n- **[Coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/)** news trends - the most **objective reporting** about bitcoin progress, price, &amp; happenings in my opinion. I stay informed on major/important bitcoin breakthroughs (eg Segwit, lightning, mimblewimble, atomic swaps...) on Coindesk - they tend to explain these new concepts really well. Remember what I said about the obituary stats - well generally coindesk will be the **first to report about events**, and mainstream media will then paraphrase events, usually adding a more negative angle to the story. Hopefully this also helps you understand how media reporting has impacts on market emotions, and therefore the price.\n\n- **Satoshi.info** -  has some very **technical bitcoin node statistics** in real-time. Dashboards include bandwidth usage, fee estimates, mem pool, p2p message stats, peer information, system metrics etc. I like using this stats website for all BTC network related research. However for basic network figures, I do feel that the Blockchain site is more appearling from a UI perspective. \n\n- **[Lightning Network](https://explorer.acinq.co/#) stats** (on testnet) - you are right to be curious about lightning. Just this testnet lightning node map really shows how successful this is going to be as these people/nodes move over to main net (the real bitcoin network), fees get cheaper, and micro-payments finally become a super efficient reality on bitcoin. \n\n- Wach how **[Segwit](http://segwit.party/charts/) adoption** is progressing steadily and surely. Also an important bitcoin statistic to pay close attention to. Looks to me that segwit will continue rising in popularity and adoption - a good thing for the cohesion and scalability of bitcoin's future :) \n\n\n", "edited": 1517475938.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://coinkapp.com/\"&gt;coinkapp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - remarkable list of bitcoin / crypto &lt;strong&gt;market capitalizations, important stats, &amp;amp; trending social topics&lt;/strong&gt;.
