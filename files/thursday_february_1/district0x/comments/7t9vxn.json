Here's an interesting flow chart for how a registry would work with examples: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DTmgYYIXUAEgrsO.jpg\n\n- **DNT will be used to signal support or disapproval for proposals made by network participants within the Aragon entity.** Aragon has a tiered voting system, modular governance models and proposal submission functions that will allow similar proposal and voting features seen in centralized institutions, however this will be handed to the DNT holders/stakers rather than a board of directors at a corporation.\n\n- **DNT will be staked to deposit pools to mint tokens providing district-specific voting rights in corresponding Aragon entities**. This is important to understand as it will be different for every district and could potentially be structured in one or all of the following governance modules: \n\n - **Futarchy** - Prediction markets are used to make decisions to align with bylaws and values. For more on this see [DAOs, Democracy, and Governance](http://merkle.com/papers/DAOdemocracyDraft.pdf) by [Ralph Merkle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Merkle). \n -   **Liquid Democracy** - A simple system that facilitates direct voting or delegate voting that allows one to remove the delegation of their vote at any time. Hence the term, 'Liquid' you can freely add or remove your vote to any delegate or participate yourself. \n - **Quadratic Voting** - You can buy voted but it gets more expensive as you do, resulting in diminishing returns. Vitalik proposed something along these lines but with a few modifications to the basic concept and can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4rtpmm/on_coinlock_voting_futarchy_and_optimal/). \n - **Reputation based systems** - A system that incorporates some of the above with additional reputation staking that puts your reputation on the line, could degrade reputation for inactivity or even require a certain level of reputation to participate in certain governance structures.\n\n---\n\nSo it's better to look at what we are building as a development standard to increase the quality of projects, communities, and markets that are looking to join the network.
