So a week and many hours later of brainstorming, tweaking, and scrapping projects I bring you my first high quality, made from scratch, original print. \n\nThe image I'm posting is low res but I am selling high res versions ready for print on my [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/576806672/stellar-lumens-vintage-crypto-currency?utm_medium=SellerListingTools&amp;utm_campaign=Share&amp;utm_source=Raw&amp;share_time=1517446215000&amp;utm_term=so.slt) page if anyone is interested. All funds will be invested and most likely lost to bad trades. \n\nAlso, I plan to make at least 5-7 more original prints for other coins (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, Litecoin, etc) and will make an album post when they're all finished.","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"7ueycu","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"clicked":false,"media_embed":{},"report_reasons":null,"author":"Beemoe4","num_crossposts":1,"saved":false,"mod_reports":[],"can_mod_post":false,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"score":5,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"preview":{"images":[{"source":{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/ScfcCnRF0EnC0FC52OYy0TaZfsaBFHsyR5RAggTNo1k.jpg?s=76b4dca28a2cc79544c0378c606f386e","width":629,"height":1030},"resolutions":[{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/ScfcCnRF0EnC0FC52OYy0TaZfsaBFHsyR5RAggTNo1k.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=262338291fc97bedf71c69e0c949ad09","width":108,"height":176},{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/ScfcCnRF0EnC0FC52OYy0TaZfsaBFHsyR5RAggTNo1k.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=55e3267cdbba0bb51b415baa311342e7","width":216,"height":353},{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/ScfcCnRF0EnC0FC52OYy0TaZfsaBFHsyR5RAggTNo1k.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=2e07fbd9358703b2edb808821a5d6aa5","width":320,"height":524}],"variants":{},"id":"DE5cwdPdXXNuRVAEbOT0Mr31mdlvYnY4IiotZKsQUzc"}],"enabled":false},"thumbnail":"self","edited":1517448107,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"contest_mode":false,"gilded":0,"downs":0,"brand_safe":true,"secure_media_embed":{},"removal_reason":null,"post_hint":"self","author_flair_text":null,"stickied":false,"can_gild":false,"thumbnail_height":null,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","name":"t3_7ueycu","spoiler":false,"permalink":"/r/Stellar/comments/7ueycu/stellar_lumens_currency_of_the_final_frontier/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"hide_score":false,"created":1517475890,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Stellar/comments/7ueycu/stellar_lumens_currency_of_the_final_frontier/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","quarantine":false,"title":"Stellar Lumens -
