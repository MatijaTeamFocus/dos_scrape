until now a confirmation they are going to issue their own ICO as well, that is service backed and asset backed.. seems pretty interesting and could possibly be launched on ripplenet as its supposedly possible for ICO use but I think where it differs from etherum is an ICO would have to piggyback XRP tokens which they would basically rebrand some XRP&amp;#39;s as their own and it would have a separate price, though im not sure I haven&amp;#39;t found much info on how ICO&amp;#39;s would work using ripplenet, anyway here is the link might need to translate the
