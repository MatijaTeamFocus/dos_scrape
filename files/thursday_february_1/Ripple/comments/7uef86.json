However, over the past several weeks, I have also been working on some additional changes.  Below are those changes.\n   \n1.  There are now three categories for \u201cOffice Type\u201d: Branch, Headquarters, and Online.  Branch and Headquarters are physical locations of the company.  Online are locations the company services, but they do not have a physical preference.  By default, the dashboard only includes Branch and Headquarters locations.  This is because including Online locations can make an organization appear larger than it is.  However, if you want to include the Online locations, simply check the box and the dashboard will update.  Currently, Online locations are only included for payment providers.\n2.  The \u201cFiat XRP Pair\u201d is a new filter.  Selecting Yes or No will include or exclude countries whose currencies currently trade against XRP.  This can be helpful to determine which companies could be using XRP but have not yet announced.  The fiat data is not in real time and comes from Coinmarketcap.com.  I try to update it once a month to keep the fiat pairs current.\n3.  The \u201cXRP Usage\u201d is a new filter.  Selecting Yes or No will include or exclude companies who have publicly announced they are using XRP in some capacity.  As of this post, these companies are Arrington XRP Capital, MoneyGram, IDT, Cuallix, MercuryFX, and FlashFX.\n   \nAll sources are cited in the dashboard and the data is publicly available on the Internet.  I built a \u201cdatabase\u201d in Excel to manage it.  Virtually all the data comes from primary sources.  What I mean by this is either from Ripple\u2019s website or the company\u2019s website.  I do not rely upon news articles, posts on Reddit, blogs, etc.  These can be good places to start, but if I cannot independently verify the information on either Ripple\u2019s website or the company\u2019s website, it generally does not make it into the dashboard.  Also, I do not rely upon non-English sources as Google Translate is imperfect.\n   \nI am bias, but I think the dashboard is a great resource.  Unlike many blogs, posts, YouTube videos, Tweets, etc., it contains no hype.  It makes no prediction about future price movement.  It does not make statements like \u201cin the long run, XRP will win out.\" It simply conveys the facts as we know them today.  Data, when presented properly, has no opinion.  It allows the end user to come to their own conclusion.\n   \nWith all of that said, I believe Ripple\u2019s and XRP\u2019s potential is massive which is why I accumulated as much as I could afford over the past several months.  Ripple\u2019s publicly known customers service virtually every country and territory.
