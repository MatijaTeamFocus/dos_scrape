I suppose the math requires knowing the maximum number of validators for Honte, so perhaps it&amp;#39;s hard to say right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "omise_go", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/omise_go/comments/7uda05/daily_discussion_february_01_2018/dtk6a7z/", "num_reports": null, "name": "t1_dtk6a7z", "created": 1517493452.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1517464652.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/omise_go", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3j3sq", "approved_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_7uda05", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "promo_specified", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3j3sq", "approved_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_7uda05", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "promo_specified", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3j3sq", "approved_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_7uda05", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dtkauq1", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MMTera", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t1_dtkafcn", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Time is the answer ,how exactly it is.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time is the answer ,how exactly it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "omise_go", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/omise_go/comments/7uda05/daily_discussion_february_01_2018/dtkauq1/", "num_reports": null, "name": "t1_dtkauq1", "created": 1517502618.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1517473818.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/omise_go", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dtkafcn", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jeneman", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t1_dtk5304", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "I have heard that they lost their cool since everyone started talking about them after their OMG investment advice.

However, just to stay somewhat grounded and be conservative, I think that the impact on the market if there were to be a sell off would probably be bigger than most people think. Despite people holding, exchanges continuing to transact, and the teams of some of these projects continuing to progress, I think it\u2019s a good idea to look at the following points. Note- these are all given under the assumption that the worst happens with Tether/Bitfinex.\n\n* The price of bitcoin to take the biggest hit- As mentioned per the article, and said by Joey Krug (Pantera/Augur/Thiel Fellowship grantee), it appears that during crashes Bitfinex has been printing significant amounts of Tether and purchasing BTC with it. This leads to the value of BTC being inflated by an influx of non-existent capital. In other words, Bitfinex has essentially been purchasing BTC with Monopoly money because the market is under the impression that the ratio of USDT/USD is 1:1, when it could be 0:1.\n\n* All of the market will take a hit- I think it\u2019s safe to say that if Bitfinex used USDT to purchase BTC, they most likely used some to purchase other coins. Sure, it may not be as significant as BTC evidenced by the price of BTC, but these will also take a hit. This is without taking into consideration that based on historical data, when BTC goes down, the market follows. It doesn\u2019t matter if ETH, OMG, or any other coin are fundamentally stronger...this is what has been proven to happen over and over again. \n\n* Mainstream investing/trading adoption of crypto- Crypto is now mainstream. You see ads on Facebook, memes on Instagram, and your morning news anchors try to figure out what the hell crypto is. Dumb money is in the market like it never has been before. The crashes of Mt Gox, July 17, and December 17 occurred during a time when your average person had not heard of Bitcoin let alone OMG. The fact that my grandma asked me if she should invest in bitconnect a month ago raises red flags all around me. There are people who have not dealt with a crash like those mentioned and who have thrown a shit ton of money at something that they don\u2019t understand, if prices start to crash they will get shaken out.\n\n* Crash leading to regulatory crackdowns- If the market crashes due to the exchange with the largest volume, committing  fraud, regulatory agencies will come down HARD on trading. I am willing to bet that people who don\u2019t understand the concept of \u201cinvest what you\u2019re willing to lose\u201d and that are all in on crypto without understanding the risk, will raise hell (unrightfully so) leading to increased pressure from the SEC. I mean fuck, does anyone remember the GDAX margin trading flash crash fiasco? If you went on the Coinbase forums you would see hundreds of people claiming that they were going to file a complaint with the SEC, ignorantly evading the fact that most of them were probably not legally allowed to margin trade.  **that was in JUNE of 2017**. What about the ICO craze? As time when by, projects and teams became more strict with who they allowed to contribute due to investors losing money bc of manipulation of people looking to make x10 returns. I bring this up as a hypothetical scenario of what exchanges could be looking to do with who they allow to purchase crypto if they are under the SEC\u2019s eye. \n\nI\u2019ll stop there as these are all assumptions based on the idea that USDT is ultimately unfounded. I\u2019ll end this by saying that despite this, I am LT bullish on crypto like I\u2019ve never been. These past few years have been exciting as hell, I\u2019ve learned so much about investing, and about how amazing Blockchain technology is. I love it. Perhaps this is the wake up call that the market needs. Let\u2019s face it, Bitcoin is overvalued, with the August 1st fork Blockstream destroyed what Satoshi\u2019s idea was, and it\u2019s scary to see that most people do not understand that. Perhaps this is the wake up call that will bring to light to everyone what ETH is, and that technically speaking, it is much stronger than Bitcoin and it\u2019s value should reflect that.

However, just to stay somewhat grounded and be conservative, I think that the impact on the market if there were to be a sell off would probably be bigger than most people think. Despite people holding, exchanges continuing to transact, and the teams of some of these projects continuing to progress, I think it\u2019s a good idea to look at the following points. Note- these are all given under the assumption that the worst happens with Tether/Bitfinex.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price of bitcoin to take the biggest hit- As mentioned per the article, and said by Joey Krug (Pantera/Augur/Thiel Fellowship grantee), it appears that during crashes Bitfinex has been printing significant amounts of Tether and purchasing BTC with it. This leads to the value of BTC being inflated by an influx of non-existent capital. In other words, Bitfinex has essentially been purchasing BTC with Monopoly money because the market is under the impression that the ratio of USDT/USD is 1:1, when it could be 0:1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the market will take a hit- I think it\u2019s safe to say that if Bitfinex used USDT to purchase BTC, they most likely used some to purchase other coins. Sure, it may not be as significant as BTC evidenced by the price of BTC, but these will also take a hit. This is without taking into consideration that based on historical data, when BTC goes down, the market follows. It doesn\u2019t matter if ETH, OMG, or any other coin are fundamentally stronger...this is what has been proven to happen over and over again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mainstream investing/trading adoption of crypto- Crypto is now mainstream.
