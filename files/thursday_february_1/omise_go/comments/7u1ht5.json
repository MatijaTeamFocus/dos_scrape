This is my opinion, since most of the questions have been more or less answered by the community or that OmiseGO has already stated in the &lt;a href=\"https://blog.omisego.network/omg-network-validation-f935523086db\"&gt;Latest Blog Post&lt;/a&gt;, or they are not currently in the place to answer the questions.&lt;br/&gt;\n&amp;nbsp;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Q1. &amp;quot;Can you list some future use cases and target markets that have not been made public yet?&amp;quot; - AndromedaExplorer  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I personally would appreciate some information or an infographic explaining the total interaction of the network alongside a business or an individual that travels from one country to another. This would allow for a greater understanding of how simplistic it will be to adopt an application that runs on OmiseGO&amp;#39;s network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;As for future markets, I believe anything financial in nature that requires a monetary transaction can be ran on the OmiseGO network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My Follow Up question to this is &amp;quot;What are the current limitations that have been seen for the network / What will the network not be able to handle?&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Q2. &amp;quot;Can you comment on how OmiseGO will be providing liquidity on the network?&amp;quot; - deasydoesit  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;This is in line to the Cash In/Out process that they are not able to reveal yet. In order for this to function a bank will need to have funding to process the payments in Fiat currency. In the event that the receiving party accepts digital currency, OmiseGO will also require a financial institution that can allow for those trades to occur. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;As there is a limited supply of Digital Currency and of Fiat Currency, there needs to be a Corporation that holds enough funding to process the requests if people are taking money off the network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Q3. &amp;quot;The community would like an updated road map.

No one has asked this questions, but it would give confidence to those waiting for a release. Since Plasma is integral to OmiseGO&amp;#39;s scaling, it would seem the increase in personnel on the project is that either they are behind, or they want to release it earlier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Further, their deadlines are slowly approaching, with most of it occurring with in the next 2-4 months.

Staking. How many tokens are needed? Returns from TX Fees?

That there is staking pools for those with less than the desired amount. And that there is a limitation on the amount of validator nodes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Computer requirements will be running an application for both an OmiseGO Node and Ethereum Node. Assuming the data transfer is not overly large, a 1-5 MB/s connection speed should be more than enough. Along with adequate disk space, preferably a HDD around 2 TB. That is my opinion as I believe this is a good average of most individuals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Q2. Partners, Conglomerates, Banks, etc...?

This is more a less round table discussion on current improvements and developments for OmiseGO, while answering community questions that they are able to provide. I would be shocked if any additional news comes out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Q3. When and how quickly will OmiseGO be adopted? (When Moon?)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;This is all relative to how many successes OmiseGO network has with the current companies that will be utilizing the network from the ground running.

Major companies will want to see how the application interacts and will provide a upgrade to their customers&amp;#39; quality of life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Further OmiseGO is one of the most stable Cryptocurrencies that I have come across. If you are looking for purely profit, this Token may not be for you.
