I expect most of you will be interested in watching the event as it can reveal or provide added information to how the project will developed over time. \n&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From a Post on the Daily Discussion it is evident that there will not be any announcements that will be coming out of this event. &amp;quot;Please note, Town Halls are for updates/feedback - not announcements.&amp;quot; -crsCR &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/omise_go/comments/7tvkua/daily_discussion_january_30_2018/\"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&amp;nbsp;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Therefore the expectation is to focus on the questions and potential feedback that may be provided. I have condensed the list to my top 3 questions that were on the &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/omise_go/comments/7r8sy3/official_questions_thread_for_omisego_town_hall/\"&gt;&amp;quot;Official Questions Thread for OmiseGO Town Hall 0x1&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; and what I believe should be the focused on during the Town Hall. This is my opinion, since most of the questions have been more or less answered by the community or that OmiseGO has already stated in the &lt;a href=\"https://blog.omisego.network/omg-network-validation-f935523086db\"&gt;Latest Blog Post&lt;/a&gt;, or they are not currently in the place to answer the questions.&lt;br/&gt;\n&amp;nbsp;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Q1. &amp;quot;Can you list some future use cases and target markets that have not been made public yet?&amp;quot; - AndromedaExplorer  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I personally would appreciate some information or an infographic explaining the total interaction of the network alongside a business or an individual that travels from one country to another. This would allow for a greater understanding of how simplistic it will be to adopt an application that runs on OmiseGO&amp;#39;s network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;As for future markets, I believe anything financial in nature that requires a monetary transaction can be ran on the OmiseGO network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My Follow Up question to this is &amp;quot;What are the current limitations that have been seen for the network / What will the network not be able to handle?&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Q2. &amp;quot;Can you comment on how OmiseGO will be providing liquidity on the network?&amp;quot; - deasydoesit  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;This is in line to the Cash In/Out process that they are not able to reveal yet. In order for this to function a bank will need to have funding to process the payments in Fiat currency. In the event that the receiving party accepts digital currency, OmiseGO will also require a financial institution that can allow for those trades to occur. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;As there is a limited supply of Digital Currency and of Fiat Currency, there needs to be a Corporation that holds enough funding to process the requests if people are taking money off the network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Q3. &amp;quot;The community would like an updated road map. When will the sdk be released? And what is the timeline for launching the OMG chain on Tendermint, Plasma, etc. ?&amp;quot; - lillbirdy  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My  modified version of the question. &amp;quot;Is the Roadmap still on track to meet its&amp;#39; required goals?&amp;quot; - Civilian&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t quite have a chance to leave a question, but I am curious if things are still on track to be met in the coming months. No one has asked this questions, but it would give confidence to those waiting for a release. Since Plasma is integral to OmiseGO&amp;#39;s scaling, it would seem the increase in personnel on the project is that either they are behind, or they want to release it earlier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Further, their deadlines are slowly approaching, with most of it occurring with in the next 2-4 months. And I believe the Town Hall will provide enough updates or feedback to answer this question.&lt;br/&gt;\n&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions Already Answered&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Q1. Staking. How many tokens are needed? Returns from TX Fees? Computer Requirements?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;All these questions have been closely related to their new Blog Post that was released. &lt;a href=\"https://blog.omisego.network/omg-network-validation-f935523086db\"&gt;OMG Network Validation&lt;/a&gt; At the moment no information is provided on an exact number, but has stated there is a floor on transaction fees. That there is staking pools for those with less than the desired amount. And that there is a limitation on the amount of validator nodes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Computer requirements will be running an application for both an OmiseGO Node and Ethereum Node. Assuming the data transfer is not overly large, a 1-5 MB/s connection speed should be more than enough. Along with adequate disk space, preferably a HDD around 2 TB. That is my opinion as I believe this is a good average of most individuals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Q2. Partners, Conglomerates, Banks, etc...?  Rumors?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;As mentioned above, this Town Hall is not to release new partnerships or any announcements. This is more a less round table discussion on current improvements and developments for OmiseGO, while answering community questions that they are able to provide. I would be shocked if any additional news comes out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Q3. When and how quickly will OmiseGO be adopted? (When Moon?)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;This is all relative to how many successes OmiseGO network has with the current companies that will be utilizing the network from the ground running. Adoption takes time and research to ensure that the product works as intended. Major companies will want to see how the application interacts and will provide a upgrade to their customers&amp;#39; quality of life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Further OmiseGO is one of the most stable Cryptocurrencies that I have come across. If you are looking for purely profit, this Token may not be for you. But if you are more interested in being part of a shift in the global financial industry, just stick around and enjoy the change.&lt;br/&gt;\n&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am looking forward to the Town Hall and I hope you are all as well. It should be interesting to hear from the team as a small update and to get community involvement. As the community continues to grow, it is important that all members have a general idea of how OmiseGO functions and that we all are able share that knowledge with others.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As always if there is incorrect information or something that needs to be added, please let me know. Hopefully many of you will be able to watch this live and that the conversation in the chat is constructive.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"Hello Everyone,  \n\nOmiseGO's Town Hall meeting is today (relative to where you live).

In the event that the receiving party accepts digital currency, OmiseGO will also require a financial institution that can allow for those trades to occur. \n- As there is a limited supply of Digital Currency and of Fiat Currency, there needs to be a Corporation that holds enough funding to process the requests if people are taking money off the network.   \n\nQ3. \"The community would like an updated road map. When will the sdk be released? And what is the timeline for launching the OMG chain on Tendermint, Plasma, etc. ?\" - lillbirdy  \n\nMy  modified version of the question. \"Is the Roadmap still on track to meet its' required goals?\" - Civilian\n\n- I didn't quite have a chance to leave a question, but I am curious if things are still on track to be met in the coming months. No one has asked this questions, but it would give confidence to those waiting for a release. Since Plasma is integral to OmiseGO's scaling, it would seem the increase in personnel on the project is that either they are behind, or they want to release it earlier.  \n- Further, their deadlines are slowly approaching, with most of it occurring with in the next 2-4 months. And I believe the Town Hall will provide enough updates or feedback to answer this question.    \n&amp;nbsp;  \n\n**Questions Already Answered**  \n\nQ1. Staking. How many tokens are needed? Returns from TX Fees? Computer Requirements?  \n\n- All these questions have been closely related to their new Blog Post that was released. [OMG Network Validation](https://blog.omisego.network/omg-network-validation-f935523086db) At the moment no information is provided on an exact number, but has stated there is a floor on transaction fees. That there is staking pools for those with less than the desired amount. And that there is a limitation on the amount of validator nodes.\n- Computer requirements will be running an application for both an OmiseGO Node and Ethereum Node. Assuming the data transfer is not overly large, a 1-5 MB/s connection speed should be more than enough. Along with adequate disk space, preferably a HDD around 2 TB. That is my opinion as I believe this is a good average of most individuals.  \n\nQ2. Partners, Conglomerates, Banks, etc...?  Rumors?\n\n- As mentioned above, this Town Hall is not to release new partnerships or any announcements. This is more a less round table discussion on current improvements and developments for OmiseGO, while answering community questions that they are able to provide. I would be shocked if any additional news comes out.  \n\nQ3. When and how quickly will OmiseGO be adopted? (When Moon?)  \n\n- This is all relative to how many successes OmiseGO network has with the current companies that will be utilizing the network from the ground running. Adoption takes time and research to ensure that the product works as intended. Major companies will want to see how the application interacts and will provide a upgrade to their customers' quality of life.  \n- Further OmiseGO is one of the most stable Cryptocurrencies that I have come across. If you are looking for purely profit, this Token may not be for you. But if you are more interested in being part of a shift in the global financial industry, just stick around and enjoy the change.    \n&amp;nbsp;  \n\n**Conclusion**  \n\nI am looking forward to the Town Hall and I hope you are all as well. It should be interesting to hear from the team as a small update and to get community involvement. As the community continues to grow, it is important that all members have a general idea of how OmiseGO functions and that we all are able share that knowledge with others.  \n\nAs always if there is incorrect information or something that needs to be added, please let me know. Hopefully many of you will be able to watch this live and that the conversation in the chat is constructive.","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"7u1ht5","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"clicked":false,"media_embed":{},"report_reasons":null,"author":"Civilian-","num_crossposts":0,"saved":false,"mod_reports":[],"can_mod_post":false,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"score":121,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"preview":{"images":[{"source":{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/h-zkaRQMDqhpcXPEYtAWG2yspJtYNaxbEdFG6TZYGxw.jpg?s=c0fe2cf0e36a90879a36e8653fcf83be","width":1200,"height":630},"resolutions":[{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/h-zkaRQMDqhpcXPEYtAWG2yspJtYNaxbEdFG6TZYGxw.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=9e1b474b8931064723296b74f196c147","width":108,"height":56},{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/h-zkaRQMDqhpcXPEYtAWG2yspJtYNaxbEdFG6TZYGxw.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=f6c418929cec0c7b2881f18b3b5b58cc","width":216,"height":113},{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/h-zkaRQMDqhpcXPEYtAWG2yspJtYNaxbEdFG6TZYGxw.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=7fb008ac4c89bdb744aff17db406f2ff","width":320,"height":168},{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/h-zkaRQMDqhpcXPEYtAWG2yspJtYNaxbEdFG6TZYGxw.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=355188b90ae7c8ee94496a4204e5bfd6","width":640,"height":336},{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/h-zkaRQMDqhpcXPEYtAWG2yspJtYNaxbEdFG6TZYGxw.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=e11a8fb54330a09807b4be6f890b67f7","width":960,"height":504},{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/h-zkaRQMDqhpcXPEYtAWG2yspJtYNaxbEdFG6TZYGxw.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=1080&amp;s=29ff592d034655f5ff7f9f312b98c411","width":1080,"height":567}],"variants":{},"id":"3wiS53EJT8I07g8y7XBykuV3TerABIpbv06coFS7Hus"}],"enabled":false},"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"contest_mode":false,"gilded":0,"downs":0,"brand_safe":false,"secure_media_embed":{},"removal_reason":null,"post_hint":"self","author_flair_text":null,"stickied":false,"can_gild":false,"thumbnail_height":null,"parent_whitelist_status":"promo_specified","name":"t3_7u1ht5","spoiler":false,"permalink":"/r/omise_go/comments/7u1ht5/omisego_upcoming_town_hall_expectations_and/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"hide_score":false,"created":1517352586,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/omise_go/comments/7u1ht5/omisego_upcoming_town_hall_expectations_and/","whitelist_status":"promo_specified","quarantine":false,"title":"OmiseGO Upcoming Town Hall - Expectations and Discussion","created_utc":1517323786,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/omise_go","ups":121,"media":null,"num_comments":43,"is_self":true,"visited":false,"mod_note":null,"is_video":false,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"self.omise_go","approved_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"num_reports":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_3j3sq","thumbnail_width":null,"subreddit":"omise_go","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been very focused on OMG for a while now and jotting down the interesting bits in wordpad whenever I read an article, listened to a podcast, watched talks/meetups and found something worth noting.
