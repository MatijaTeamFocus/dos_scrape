Directly from the Tor website the only known theoretical exploit remaining is an entry and exit node attack. \nLet me explain this briefly:\nAn exit node is when traffic goes from a Tor protected node on the network to a non-protected Tor node (ie. a clear node). An entry node is when you go from a clear node to a Tor node. If you can watch traffic at both ends of the network then you can perform sophisticated attacks to profile a user‚Äôs behavior.\nThe publication that Noah linked to explains that you can inject malicious Tor nodes into the Bitcoin network and spam the network causing all the ‚Äúgood‚Äù ones to be kicked and thereby the malicious nodes take over the network. This Coindesk article explains it in a more digestible format. The key piece of this exploit is exit nodes:\nThey explained that, when a Tor user connects to the bitcoin network, his or her IP address is not revealed. Instead, the bitcoin server sees the address of the connected Tor ‚Äòexit node‚Äô, a type of server. As a result, an attacker could send enough bad transactions over Tor to get all the exit nodes banned by the bitcoin network\nThe difference with Verge is that with the next release there won‚Äôt be any entry or exit nodes. Once upgraded, every node on the network will be transacting over Tor because when you start a network node it will also be a Tor node.","ups":4,"downs":0,"score":4,"created":1515963464,"depth":2,"comments":[{"body":"This has nothing to do with spent outputs and inputs and how they're obfuscated from the stealth addresses.

Directly from the Tor website the only known theoretical exploit remaining is an entry and exit node attack. \nLet me explain this briefly:\nAn exit node is when traffic goes from a Tor protected node on the network to a non-protected Tor node (ie. a clear node). An entry node is when you go from a clear node to a Tor node. If you can watch traffic at both ends of the network then you can perform sophisticated attacks to profile a user‚Äôs behavior.\nThe publication that Noah linked to explains that you can inject malicious Tor nodes into the Bitcoin network and spam the network causing all the ‚Äúgood‚Äù ones to be kicked and thereby the malicious nodes take over the network. This Coindesk article explains it in a more digestible format. The key piece of this exploit is exit nodes:\nThey explained that, when a Tor user connects to the bitcoin network, his or her IP address is not revealed. Instead, the bitcoin server sees the address of the connected Tor ‚Äòexit node‚Äô, a type of server. As a result, an attacker could send enough bad transactions over Tor to get all the exit nodes banned by the bitcoin network\nThe difference with Verge is that with the next release there won‚Äôt be any entry or exit nodes. Once upgraded, every node on the network will be transacting over Tor because when you start a network node it will also be a Tor node.","ups":4,"downs":0,"score":4,"created":1515963464,"depth":2,"comments":[{"body":"This has nothing to do with spent outputs and inputs and how they're obfuscated from the stealth addresses.

Directly from the Tor website the only known theoretical exploit remaining is an entry and exit node attack. \nLet me explain this briefly:\nAn exit node is when traffic goes from a Tor protected node on the network to a non-protected Tor node (ie. a clear node). An entry node is when you go from a clear node to a Tor node. If you can watch traffic at both ends of the network then you can perform sophisticated attacks to profile a user‚Äôs behavior.\nThe publication that Noah linked to explains that you can inject malicious Tor nodes into the Bitcoin network and spam the network causing all the ‚Äúgood‚Äù ones to be kicked and thereby the malicious nodes take over the network. This Coindesk article explains it in a more digestible format. The key piece of this exploit is exit nodes:\nThey explained that, when a Tor user connects to the bitcoin network, his or her IP address is not revealed. Instead, the bitcoin server sees the address of the connected Tor ‚Äòexit node‚Äô, a type of server. As a result, an attacker could send enough bad transactions over Tor to get all the exit nodes banned by the bitcoin network\nThe difference with Verge is that with the next release there won‚Äôt be any entry or exit nodes. Once upgraded, every node on the network will be transacting over Tor because when you start a network node it will also be a Tor node.","ups":4,"downs":0,"score":4,"created":1515963464,"depth":2,"comments":[{"body":"This has nothing to do with spent outputs and inputs and how they're obfuscated from the stealth addresses.

Directly from the Tor website the only known theoretical exploit remaining is an entry and exit node attack. \nLet me explain this briefly:\nAn exit node is when traffic goes from a Tor protected node on the network to a non-protected Tor node (ie. a clear node). An entry node is when you go from a clear node to a Tor node. If you can watch traffic at both ends of the network then you can perform sophisticated attacks to profile a user‚Äôs behavior.\nThe publication that Noah linked to explains that you can inject malicious Tor nodes into the Bitcoin network and spam the network causing all the ‚Äúgood‚Äù ones to be kicked and thereby the malicious nodes take over the network. This Coindesk article explains it in a more digestible format. The key piece of this exploit is exit nodes:\nThey explained that, when a Tor user connects to the bitcoin network, his or her IP address is not revealed. Instead, the bitcoin server sees the address of the connected Tor ‚Äòexit node‚Äô, a type of server. As a result, an attacker could send enough bad transactions over Tor to get all the exit nodes banned by the bitcoin network\nThe difference with Verge is that with the next release there won‚Äôt be any entry or exit nodes. Once upgraded, every node on the network will be transacting over Tor because when you start a network node it will also be a Tor node.","ups":4,"downs":0,"score":4,"created":1515963464,"depth":2,"comments":[{"body":"This has nothing to do with spent outputs and inputs and how they're obfuscated from the stealth addresses.

Directly from the Tor website the only known theoretical exploit remaining is an entry and exit node attack. \nLet me explain this briefly:\nAn exit node is when traffic goes from a Tor protected node on the network to a non-protected Tor node (ie. a clear node). An entry node is when you go from a clear node to a Tor node. If you can watch traffic at both ends of the network then you can perform sophisticated attacks to profile a user‚Äôs behavior.\nThe publication that Noah linked to explains that you can inject malicious Tor nodes into the Bitcoin network and spam the network causing all the ‚Äúgood‚Äù ones to be kicked and thereby the malicious nodes take over the network. This Coindesk article explains it in a more digestible format. The key piece of this exploit is exit nodes:\nThey explained that, when a Tor user connects to the bitcoin network, his or her IP address is not revealed. Instead, the bitcoin server sees the address of the connected Tor ‚Äòexit node‚Äô, a type of server. As a result, an attacker could send enough bad transactions over Tor to get all the exit nodes banned by the bitcoin network\nThe difference with Verge is that with the next release there won‚Äôt be any entry or exit nodes. Once upgraded, every node on the network will be transacting over Tor because when you start a network node it will also be a Tor node.","ups":4,"downs":0,"score":4,"created":1515963464,"depth":2,"comments":[{"body":"This has nothing to do with spent outputs and inputs and how they're obfuscated from the stealth addresses.

Directly from the Tor website the only known theoretical exploit remaining is an entry and exit node attack. \nLet me explain this briefly:\nAn exit node is when traffic goes from a Tor protected node on the network to a non-protected Tor node (ie. a clear node). An entry node is when you go from a clear node to a Tor node. If you can watch traffic at both ends of the network then you can perform sophisticated attacks to profile a user‚Äôs behavior.\nThe publication that Noah linked to explains that you can inject malicious Tor nodes into the Bitcoin network and spam the network causing all the ‚Äúgood‚Äù ones to be kicked and thereby the malicious nodes take over the network. This Coindesk article explains it in a more digestible format. The key piece of this exploit is exit nodes:\nThey explained that, when a Tor user connects to the bitcoin network, his or her IP address is not revealed. Instead, the bitcoin server sees the address of the connected Tor ‚Äòexit node‚Äô, a type of server. As a result, an attacker could send enough bad transactions over Tor to get all the exit nodes banned by the bitcoin network\nThe difference with Verge is that with the next release there won‚Äôt be any entry or exit nodes. Once upgraded, every node on the network will be transacting over Tor because when you start a network node it will also be a Tor node.","ups":4,"downs":0,"score":4,"created":1515963464,"depth":2,"comments":[{"body":"This has nothing to do with spent outputs and inputs and how they're obfuscated from the stealth addresses.

Directly from the Tor website the only known theoretical exploit remaining is an entry and exit node attack. \nLet me explain this briefly:\nAn exit node is when traffic goes from a Tor protected node on the network to a non-protected Tor node (ie. a clear node). An entry node is when you go from a clear node to a Tor node. If you can watch traffic at both ends of the network then you can perform sophisticated attacks to profile a user‚Äôs behavior.\nThe publication that Noah linked to explains that you can inject malicious Tor nodes into the Bitcoin network and spam the network causing all the ‚Äúgood‚Äù ones to be kicked and thereby the malicious nodes take over the network. This Coindesk article explains it in a more digestible format. The key piece of this exploit is exit nodes:\nThey explained that, when a Tor user connects to the bitcoin network, his or her IP address is not revealed. Instead, the bitcoin server sees the address of the connected Tor ‚Äòexit node‚Äô, a type of server. As a result, an attacker could send enough bad transactions over Tor to get all the exit nodes banned by the bitcoin network\nThe difference with Verge is that with the next release there won‚Äôt be any entry or exit nodes. Once upgraded, every node on the network will be transacting over Tor because when you start a network node it will also be a Tor node.","ups":4,"downs":0,"score":4,"created":1515963464,"depth":2,"comments":[{"body":"This has nothing to do with spent outputs and inputs and how they're obfuscated from the stealth addresses.

Directly from the Tor website the only known theoretical exploit remaining is an entry and exit node attack. \nLet me explain this briefly:\nAn exit node is when traffic goes from a Tor protected node on the network to a non-protected Tor node (ie. a clear node). An entry node is when you go from a clear node to a Tor node. If you can watch traffic at both ends of the network then you can perform sophisticated attacks to profile a user‚Äôs behavior.\nThe publication that Noah linked to explains that you can inject malicious Tor nodes into the Bitcoin network and spam the network causing all the ‚Äúgood‚Äù ones to be kicked and thereby the malicious nodes take over the network. This Coindesk article explains it in a more digestible format. The key piece of this exploit is exit nodes:\nThey explained that, when a Tor user connects to the bitcoin network, his or her IP address is not revealed. Instead, the bitcoin server sees the address of the connected Tor ‚Äòexit node‚Äô, a type of server. As a result, an attacker could send enough bad transactions over Tor to get all the exit nodes banned by the bitcoin network\nThe difference with Verge is that with the next release there won‚Äôt be any entry or exit nodes. Once upgraded, every node on the network will be transacting over Tor because when you start a network node it will also be a Tor node.","ups":4,"downs":0,"score":4,"created":1515963464,"depth":2,"comments":[{"body":"This has nothing to do with spent outputs and inputs and how they're obfuscated from the stealth addresses.

Directly from the Tor website the only known theoretical exploit remaining is an entry and exit node attack. \nLet me explain this briefly:\nAn exit node is when traffic goes from a Tor protected node on the network to a non-protected Tor node (ie. a clear node). An entry node is when you go from a clear node to a Tor node. If you can watch traffic at both ends of the network then you can perform sophisticated attacks to profile a user‚Äôs behavior.\nThe publication that Noah linked to explains that you can inject malicious Tor nodes into the Bitcoin network and spam the network causing all the ‚Äúgood‚Äù ones to be kicked and thereby the malicious nodes take over the network. This Coindesk article explains it in a more digestible format. The key piece of this exploit is exit nodes:\nThey explained that, when a Tor user connects to the bitcoin network, his or her IP address is not revealed. Instead, the bitcoin server sees the address of the connected Tor ‚Äòexit node‚Äô, a type of server. As a result, an attacker could send enough bad transactions over Tor to get all the exit nodes banned by the bitcoin network\nThe difference with Verge is that with the next release there won‚Äôt be any entry or exit nodes. Once upgraded, every node on the network will be transacting over Tor because when you start a network node it will also be a Tor node.","ups":4,"downs":0,"score":4,"created":1515963464,"depth":2,"comments":[{"body":"This has nothing to do with spent outputs and inputs and how they're obfuscated from the stealth addresses.

Directly from the Tor website the only known theoretical exploit remaining is an entry and exit node attack. \nLet me explain this briefly:\nAn exit node is when traffic goes from a Tor protected node on the network to a non-protected Tor node (ie. a clear node). An entry node is when you go from a clear node to a Tor node. If you can watch traffic at both ends of the network then you can perform sophisticated attacks to profile a user‚Äôs behavior.\nThe publication that Noah linked to explains that you can inject malicious Tor nodes into the Bitcoin network and spam the network causing all the ‚Äúgood‚Äù ones to be kicked and thereby the malicious nodes take over the network. This Coindesk article explains it in a more digestible format. The key piece of this exploit is exit nodes:\nThey explained that, when a Tor user connects to the bitcoin network, his or her IP address is not revealed. Instead, the bitcoin server sees the address of the connected Tor ‚Äòexit node‚Äô, a type of server. As a result, an attacker could send enough bad transactions over Tor to get all the exit nodes banned by the bitcoin network\nThe difference with Verge is that with the next release there won‚Äôt be any entry or exit nodes. Once upgraded, every node on the network will be transacting over Tor because when you start a network node it will also be a Tor node.","ups":4,"downs":0,"score":4,"created":1515963464,"depth":2,"comments":[{"body":"This has nothing to do with spent outputs and inputs and how they're obfuscated from the stealth addresses.

Directly from the Tor website the only known theoretical exploit remaining is an entry and exit node attack. \nLet me explain this briefly:\nAn exit node is when traffic goes from a Tor protected node on the network to a non-protected Tor node (ie. a clear node). An entry node is when you go from a clear node to a Tor node. If you can watch traffic at both ends of the network then you can perform sophisticated attacks to profile a user‚Äôs behavior.\nThe publication that Noah linked to explains that you can inject malicious Tor nodes into the Bitcoin network and spam the network causing all the ‚Äúgood‚Äù ones to be kicked and thereby the malicious nodes take over the network. This Coindesk article explains it in a more digestible format. The key piece of this exploit is exit nodes:\nThey explained that, when a Tor user connects to the bitcoin network, his or her IP address is not revealed. Instead, the bitcoin server sees the address of the connected Tor ‚Äòexit node‚Äô, a type of server. As a result, an attacker could send enough bad transactions over Tor to get all the exit nodes banned by the bitcoin network\nThe difference with Verge is that with the next release there won‚Äôt be any entry or exit nodes. Once upgraded, every node on the network will be transacting over Tor because when you start a network node it will also be a Tor node.","ups":4,"downs":0,"score":4,"created":1515963464,"depth":2,"comments":[{"body":"This has nothing to do with spent outputs and inputs and how they're obfuscated from the stealth addresses.

Directly from the Tor website the only known theoretical exploit remaining is an entry and exit node attack. \nLet me explain this briefly:\nAn exit node is when traffic goes from a Tor protected node on the network to a non-protected Tor node (ie. a clear node). An entry node is when you go from a clear node to a Tor node. If you can watch traffic at both ends of the network then you can perform sophisticated attacks to profile a user‚Äôs behavior.\nThe publication that Noah linked to explains that you can inject malicious Tor nodes into the Bitcoin network and spam the network causing all the ‚Äúgood‚Äù ones to be kicked and thereby the malicious nodes take over the network. This Coindesk article explains it in a more digestible format. The key piece of this exploit is exit nodes:\nThey explained that, when a Tor user connects to the bitcoin network, his or her IP address is not revealed. Instead, the bitcoin server sees the address of the connected Tor ‚Äòexit node‚Äô, a type of server. As a result, an attacker could send enough bad transactions over Tor to get all the exit nodes banned by the bitcoin network\nThe difference with Verge is that with the next release there won‚Äôt be any entry or exit nodes. Once upgraded, every node on the network will be transacting over Tor because when you start a network node it will also be a Tor node.","ups":4,"downs":0,"score":4,"created":1515963464,"depth":2,"comments":[{"body":"This has nothing to do with spent outputs and inputs and how they're obfuscated from the stealth addresses.

Directly from the Tor website the only known theoretical exploit remaining is an entry and exit node attack. \nLet me explain this briefly:\nAn exit node is when traffic goes from a Tor protected node on the network to a non-protected Tor node (ie. a clear node). An entry node is when you go from a clear node to a Tor node. If you can watch traffic at both ends of the network then you can perform sophisticated attacks to profile a user‚Äôs behavior.\nThe publication that Noah linked to explains that you can inject malicious Tor nodes into the Bitcoin network and spam the network causing all the ‚Äúgood‚Äù ones to be kicked and thereby the malicious nodes take over the network. This Coindesk article explains it in a more digestible format. The key piece of this exploit is exit nodes:\nThey explained that, when a Tor user connects to the bitcoin network, his or her IP address is not revealed. Instead, the bitcoin server sees the address of the connected Tor ‚Äòexit node‚Äô, a type of server. As a result, an attacker could send enough bad transactions over Tor to get all the exit nodes banned by the bitcoin network\nThe difference with Verge is that with the next release there won‚Äôt be any entry or exit nodes. Once upgraded, every node on the network will be transacting over Tor because when you start a network node it will also be a Tor node.","ups":4,"downs":0,"score":4,"created":1515963464,"depth":2,"comments":[{"body":"This has nothing to do with spent outputs and inputs and how they're obfuscated from the stealth addresses.

Directly from the Tor website the only known theoretical exploit remaining is an entry and exit node attack. \nLet me explain this briefly:\nAn exit node is when traffic goes from a Tor protected node on the network to a non-protected Tor node (ie. a clear node). An entry node is when you go from a clear node to a Tor node. If you can watch traffic at both ends of the network then you can perform sophisticated attacks to profile a user‚Äôs behavior.\nThe publication that Noah linked to explains that you can inject malicious Tor nodes into the Bitcoin network and spam the network causing all the ‚Äúgood‚Äù ones to be kicked and thereby the malicious nodes take over the network. This Coindesk article explains it in a more digestible format. The key piece of this exploit is exit nodes:\nThey explained that, when a Tor user connects to the bitcoin network, his or her IP address is not revealed. Instead, the bitcoin server sees the address of the connected Tor ‚Äòexit node‚Äô, a type of server. As a result, an attacker could send enough bad transactions over Tor to get all the exit nodes banned by the bitcoin network\nThe difference with Verge is that with the next release there won‚Äôt be any entry or exit nodes. Once upgraded, every node on the network will be transacting over Tor because when you start a network node it will also be a Tor node.","ups":4,"downs":0,"score":4,"created":1515963464,"depth":2,"comments":[{"body":"This has nothing to do with spent outputs and inputs and how they're obfuscated from the stealth addresses.

Directly from the Tor website the only known theoretical exploit remaining is an entry and exit node attack. \nLet me explain this briefly:\nAn exit node is when traffic goes from a Tor protected node on the network to a non-protected Tor node (ie. a clear node). An entry node is when you go from a clear node to a Tor node. If you can watch traffic at both ends of the network then you can perform sophisticated attacks to profile a user‚Äôs behavior.\nThe publication that Noah linked to explains that you can inject malicious Tor nodes into the Bitcoin network and spam the network causing all the ‚Äúgood‚Äù ones to be kicked and thereby the malicious nodes take over the network. This Coindesk article explains it in a more digestible format. The key piece of this exploit is exit nodes:\nThey explained that, when a Tor user connects to the bitcoin network, his or her IP address is not revealed. Instead, the bitcoin server sees the address of the connected Tor ‚Äòexit node‚Äô, a type of server. As a result, an attacker could send enough bad transactions over Tor to get all the exit nodes banned by the bitcoin network\nThe difference with Verge is that with the next release there won‚Äôt be any entry or exit nodes. Once upgraded, every node on the network will be transacting over Tor because when you start a network node it will also be a Tor node.","ups":4,"downs":0,"score":4,"created":1515963464,"depth":2,"comments":[{"body":"This has nothing to do with spent outputs and inputs and how they're obfuscated from the stealth addresses.

Directly from the Tor website the only known theoretical exploit remaining is an entry and exit node attack. \nLet me explain this briefly:\nAn exit node is when traffic goes from a Tor protected node on the network to a non-protected Tor node (ie. a clear node). An entry node is when you go from a clear node to a Tor node. If you can watch traffic at both ends of the network then you can perform sophisticated attacks to profile a user‚Äôs behavior.\nThe publication that Noah linked to explains that you can inject malicious Tor nodes into the Bitcoin network and spam the network causing all the ‚Äúgood‚Äù ones to be kicked and thereby the malicious nodes take over the network. This Coindesk article explains it in a more digestible format. The key piece of this exploit is exit nodes:\nThey explained that, when a Tor user connects to the bitcoin network, his or her IP address is not revealed. Instead, the bitcoin server sees the address of the connected Tor ‚Äòexit node‚Äô, a type of server. As a result, an attacker could send enough bad transactions over Tor to get all the exit nodes banned by the bitcoin network\nThe difference with Verge is that with the next release there won‚Äôt be any entry or exit nodes. Once upgraded, every node on the network will be transacting over Tor because when you start a network node it will also be a Tor node.","ups":4,"downs":0,"score":4,"created":1515963464,"depth":2,"comments":[{"body":"This has nothing to do with spent outputs and inputs and how they're obfuscated from the stealth addresses.

Directly from the Tor website the only known theoretical exploit remaining is an entry and exit node attack. \nLet me explain this briefly:\nAn exit node is when traffic goes from a Tor protected node on the network to a non-protected Tor node (ie. a clear node). An entry node is when you go from a clear node to a Tor node. If you can watch traffic at both ends of the network then you can perform sophisticated attacks to profile a user‚Äôs behavior.\nThe publication that Noah linked to explains that you can inject malicious Tor nodes into the Bitcoin network and spam the network causing all the ‚Äúgood‚Äù ones to be kicked and thereby the malicious nodes take over the network. This Coindesk article explains it in a more digestible format. The key piece of this exploit is exit nodes:\nThey explained that, when a Tor user connects to the bitcoin network, his or her IP address is not revealed. Instead, the bitcoin server sees the address of the connected Tor ‚Äòexit node‚Äô, a type of server. As a result, an attacker could send enough bad transactions over Tor to get all the exit nodes banned by the bitcoin network\nThe difference with Verge is that with the next release there won‚Äôt be any entry or exit nodes. Once upgraded, every node on the network will be transacting over Tor because when you start a network node it will also be a Tor node.","ups":4,"downs":0,"score":4,"created":1515963464,"depth":2,"comments":[{"body":"This has nothing to do with spent outputs and inputs and how they're obfuscated from the stealth addresses.

Directly from the Tor website the only known theoretical exploit remaining is an entry and exit node attack. \nLet me explain this briefly:\nAn exit node is when traffic goes from a Tor protected node on the network to a non-protected Tor node (ie. a clear node). An entry node is when you go from a clear node to a Tor node. If you can watch traffic at both ends of the network then you can perform sophisticated attacks to profile a user‚Äôs behavior.\nThe publication that Noah linked to explains that you can inject malicious Tor nodes into the Bitcoin network and spam the network causing all the ‚Äúgood‚Äù ones to be kicked and thereby the malicious nodes take over the network. This Coindesk article explains it in a more digestible format. The key piece of this exploit is exit nodes:\nThey explained that, when a Tor user connects to the bitcoin network, his or her IP address is not revealed. Instead, the bitcoin server sees the address of the connected Tor ‚Äòexit node‚Äô, a type of server. As a result, an attacker could send enough bad transactions over Tor to get all the exit nodes banned by the bitcoin network\nThe difference with Verge is that with the next release there won‚Äôt be any entry or exit nodes. Once upgraded, every node on the network will be transacting over Tor because when you start a network node it will also be a Tor node.","ups":4,"downs":0,"score":4,"created":1515963464,"depth":2,"comments":[{"body":"This has nothing to do with spent outputs and inputs and how they're obfuscated from the stealth addresses.
