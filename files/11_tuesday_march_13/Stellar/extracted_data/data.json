Essentially purchasing a building in the outskirts of Vilnius, Lithuanian capital, and converting it into a cultural center with artists studios, recording studios, events space etc. The idea is that the large old industrial building would be self sustaining, accomodating and employing a constant flow of people on a work share basis while perhaps a restaurant and regular events would provide a continued source of fundraising. I will follow this post with proper proposals of the project and everyone involved but i am posting this initially to gauge what this particular community thinks of raising stellar for a project like this, how it might best be done and looking to the future how the currency might be integrated into the daily functioning of the project. I have been trading a little while but my knowledge is pretty cursory, Stellar has been very good to me and the community is probably least toxic and most reasoned i have come across in the Crypto sphere so thats why im starting here.

All 100B XRP already exist.  38B are inciruclation. 54B are locked up in 55 1B escrows, and the remaining 7B are locked up in a lawsuit.\n\nThe \"printing\" you refer to is actually the company selling XRP to companies with agreements that the will not be sold but used. \n\n&gt;  (the coin has actually 0 use case. yep.

It lets you facilitate multi-currency and asset transactions quickly, reliably, and for a fraction of a penny by using a crypto-asset called Lumens (XLM) as a bridge.\n\n\n* [The Stellar Consensus Protocol | Talks At Google (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmwnhZmEZjc) \n\n\n* [The Stellar Foundation Mandate &amp; Governance] (https://www.stellar.org/about/mandate/)\n\n\n* [Jed McCaleb on Bitcoin &amp; Stellar (video)] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRk2FoEy2Ew)\n\n\n* [How The Stellar Network Operates (pdf)](https://www.stellar.org/how-it-works/stellar-basics/#)\n\n\n* [How Money Moves On Stellar (video)] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA53r43vGCA&amp;t=2s)\n\n\n* [Lumens (XLM) FAQ](https://www.stellar.org/lumens/)\n\n\n##Where Do I Start?\nYou want to start by getting yourself a Stellar Wallet: \n\n* [StellarTerm, A Web-Based Stellar Trading Client] (https://stellarterm.com/) \n\n\n* [Stellar Lumen Wallet Options] (https://www.stellar.org/lumens/wallets/)\n\n\n##Now What?\nGet lumens, build apps, do an ICO, and dive into Stellar:  \n\n\n* [Where To Get Lumens](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/stellar/#markets)\n\n\n* [Raise Funds &amp; ICO On Stellar](https://www.stellar.org/blog/using-stellar-for-ico/) \n\n\n* [Beginner’s Guide To The Stellar Network (for Developers)](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/get-started/)\n\n\n* [Read The Documentation](https://www.stellar.org/developers/)\n\n\n* [Participate In The Stellar Build Challenge (Win Lumens)](https://www.stellar.org/lumens/build/)\n\n\n* [Check Out Stellar Meetups In Your Area] (https://www.meetup.com/preview/Stellar-SF/events/244117321)\n\n* [How To Tip XLM on r/Stellar] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Stellar/comments/7zz8wl/how_to_tip_on_reddit_using_stellar_lumens/)\n\n\n\n=============\n#RULES\n=============\nBelow are the rules that Reddit users on *r/Stellar* must follow to participate.

Essentially purchasing a building in the outskirts of Vilnius, Lithuanian capital, and converting it into a cultural center with artists studios, recording studios, events space etc. The idea is that the large old industrial building would be self sustaining, accomodating and employing a constant flow of people on a work share basis while perhaps a restaurant and regular events would provide a continued source of fundraising. I will follow this post with proper proposals of the project and everyone involved but i am posting this initially to gauge what this particular community thinks of raising stellar for a project like this, how it might best be done and looking to the future how the currency might be integrated into the daily functioning of the project. I have been trading a little while but my knowledge is pretty cursory, Stellar has been very good to me and the community is probably least toxic and most reasoned i have come across in the Crypto sphere so thats why im starting here.

All 100B XRP already exist.  38B are inciruclation. 54B are locked up in 55 1B escrows, and the remaining 7B are locked up in a lawsuit.\n\nThe \"printing\" you refer to is actually the company selling XRP to companies with agreements that the will not be sold but used. \n\n&gt;  (the coin has actually 0 use case. yep.

It lets you facilitate multi-currency and asset transactions quickly, reliably, and for a fraction of a penny by using a crypto-asset called Lumens (XLM) as a bridge.\n\n\n* [The Stellar Consensus Protocol | Talks At Google (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmwnhZmEZjc) \n\n\n* [The Stellar Foundation Mandate &amp; Governance] (https://www.stellar.org/about/mandate/)\n\n\n* [Jed McCaleb on Bitcoin &amp; Stellar (video)] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRk2FoEy2Ew)\n\n\n* [How The Stellar Network Operates (pdf)](https://www.stellar.org/how-it-works/stellar-basics/#)\n\n\n* [How Money Moves On Stellar (video)] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA53r43vGCA&amp;t=2s)\n\n\n* [Lumens (XLM) FAQ](https://www.stellar.org/lumens/)\n\n\n##Where Do I Start?\nYou want to start by getting yourself a Stellar Wallet: \n\n* [StellarTerm, A Web-Based Stellar Trading Client] (https://stellarterm.com/) \n\n\n* [Stellar Lumen Wallet Options] (https://www.stellar.org/lumens/wallets/)\n\n\n##Now What?\nGet lumens, build apps, do an ICO, and dive into Stellar:  \n\n\n* [Where To Get Lumens](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/stellar/#markets)\n\n\n* [Raise Funds &amp; ICO On Stellar](https://www.stellar.org/blog/using-stellar-for-ico/) \n\n\n* [Beginner’s Guide To The Stellar Network (for Developers)](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/get-started/)\n\n\n* [Read The Documentation](https://www.stellar.org/developers/)\n\n\n* [Participate In The Stellar Build Challenge (Win Lumens)](https://www.stellar.org/lumens/build/)\n\n\n* [Check Out Stellar Meetups In Your Area] (https://www.meetup.com/preview/Stellar-SF/events/244117321)\n\n* [How To Tip XLM on r/Stellar] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Stellar/comments/7zz8wl/how_to_tip_on_reddit_using_stellar_lumens/)\n\n\n\n=============\n#RULES\n=============\nBelow are the rules that Reddit users on *r/Stellar* must follow to participate.

Essentially purchasing a building in the outskirts of Vilnius, Lithuanian capital, and converting it into a cultural center with artists studios, recording studios, events space etc. The idea is that the large old industrial building would be self sustaining, accomodating and employing a constant flow of people on a work share basis while perhaps a restaurant and regular events would provide a continued source of fundraising. I will follow this post with proper proposals of the project and everyone involved but i am posting this initially to gauge what this particular community thinks of raising stellar for a project like this, how it might best be done and looking to the future how the currency might be integrated into the daily functioning of the project. I have been trading a little while but my knowledge is pretty cursory, Stellar has been very good to me and the community is probably least toxic and most reasoned i have come across in the Crypto sphere so thats why im starting here.

All 100B XRP already exist.  38B are inciruclation. 54B are locked up in 55 1B escrows, and the remaining 7B are locked up in a lawsuit.\n\nThe \"printing\" you refer to is actually the company selling XRP to companies with agreements that the will not be sold but used. \n\n&gt;  (the coin has actually 0 use case. yep.

It lets you facilitate multi-currency and asset transactions quickly, reliably, and for a fraction of a penny by using a crypto-asset called Lumens (XLM) as a bridge.\n\n\n* [The Stellar Consensus Protocol | Talks At Google (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmwnhZmEZjc) \n\n\n* [The Stellar Foundation Mandate &amp; Governance] (https://www.stellar.org/about/mandate/)\n\n\n* [Jed McCaleb on Bitcoin &amp; Stellar (video)] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRk2FoEy2Ew)\n\n\n* [How The Stellar Network Operates (pdf)](https://www.stellar.org/how-it-works/stellar-basics/#)\n\n\n* [How Money Moves On Stellar (video)] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA53r43vGCA&amp;t=2s)\n\n\n* [Lumens (XLM) FAQ](https://www.stellar.org/lumens/)\n\n\n##Where Do I Start?\nYou want to start by getting yourself a Stellar Wallet: \n\n* [StellarTerm, A Web-Based Stellar Trading Client] (https://stellarterm.com/) \n\n\n* [Stellar Lumen Wallet Options] (https://www.stellar.org/lumens/wallets/)\n\n\n##Now What?\nGet lumens, build apps, do an ICO, and dive into Stellar:  \n\n\n* [Where To Get Lumens](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/stellar/#markets)\n\n\n* [Raise Funds &amp; ICO On Stellar](https://www.stellar.org/blog/using-stellar-for-ico/) \n\n\n* [Beginner’s Guide To The Stellar Network (for Developers)](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/get-started/)\n\n\n* [Read The Documentation](https://www.stellar.org/developers/)\n\n\n* [Participate In The Stellar Build Challenge (Win Lumens)](https://www.stellar.org/lumens/build/)\n\n\n* [Check Out Stellar Meetups In Your Area] (https://www.meetup.com/preview/Stellar-SF/events/244117321)\n\n* [How To Tip XLM on r/Stellar] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Stellar/comments/7zz8wl/how_to_tip_on_reddit_using_stellar_lumens/)\n\n\n\n=============\n#RULES\n=============\nBelow are the rules that Reddit users on *r/Stellar* must follow to participate.

Essentially purchasing a building in the outskirts of Vilnius, Lithuanian capital, and converting it into a cultural center with artists studios, recording studios, events space etc. The idea is that the large old industrial building would be self sustaining, accomodating and employing a constant flow of people on a work share basis while perhaps a restaurant and regular events would provide a continued source of fundraising. I will follow this post with proper proposals of the project and everyone involved but i am posting this initially to gauge what this particular community thinks of raising stellar for a project like this, how it might best be done and looking to the future how the currency might be integrated into the daily functioning of the project. I have been trading a little while but my knowledge is pretty cursory, Stellar has been very good to me and the community is probably least toxic and most reasoned i have come across in the Crypto sphere so thats why im starting here.

All 100B XRP already exist.  38B are inciruclation. 54B are locked up in 55 1B escrows, and the remaining 7B are locked up in a lawsuit.\n\nThe \"printing\" you refer to is actually the company selling XRP to companies with agreements that the will not be sold but used. \n\n&gt;  (the coin has actually 0 use case. yep.

It lets you facilitate multi-currency and asset transactions quickly, reliably, and for a fraction of a penny by using a crypto-asset called Lumens (XLM) as a bridge.\n\n\n* [The Stellar Consensus Protocol | Talks At Google (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmwnhZmEZjc) \n\n\n* [The Stellar Foundation Mandate &amp; Governance] (https://www.stellar.org/about/mandate/)\n\n\n* [Jed McCaleb on Bitcoin &amp; Stellar (video)] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRk2FoEy2Ew)\n\n\n* [How The Stellar Network Operates (pdf)](https://www.stellar.org/how-it-works/stellar-basics/#)\n\n\n* [How Money Moves On Stellar (video)] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA53r43vGCA&amp;t=2s)\n\n\n* [Lumens (XLM) FAQ](https://www.stellar.org/lumens/)\n\n\n##Where Do I Start?\nYou want to start by getting yourself a Stellar Wallet: \n\n* [StellarTerm, A Web-Based Stellar Trading Client] (https://stellarterm.com/) \n\n\n* [Stellar Lumen Wallet Options] (https://www.stellar.org/lumens/wallets/)\n\n\n##Now What?\nGet lumens, build apps, do an ICO, and dive into Stellar:  \n\n\n* [Where To Get Lumens](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/stellar/#markets)\n\n\n* [Raise Funds &amp; ICO On Stellar](https://www.stellar.org/blog/using-stellar-for-ico/) \n\n\n* [Beginner’s Guide To The Stellar Network (for Developers)](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/get-started/)\n\n\n* [Read The Documentation](https://www.stellar.org/developers/)\n\n\n* [Participate In The Stellar Build Challenge (Win Lumens)](https://www.stellar.org/lumens/build/)\n\n\n* [Check Out Stellar Meetups In Your Area] (https://www.meetup.com/preview/Stellar-SF/events/244117321)\n\n* [How To Tip XLM on r/Stellar] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Stellar/comments/7zz8wl/how_to_tip_on_reddit_using_stellar_lumens/)\n\n\n\n=============\n#RULES\n=============\nBelow are the rules that Reddit users on *r/Stellar* must follow to participate.

Essentially purchasing a building in the outskirts of Vilnius, Lithuanian capital, and converting it into a cultural center with artists studios, recording studios, events space etc. The idea is that the large old industrial building would be self sustaining, accomodating and employing a constant flow of people on a work share basis while perhaps a restaurant and regular events would provide a continued source of fundraising. I will follow this post with proper proposals of the project and everyone involved but i am posting this initially to gauge what this particular community thinks of raising stellar for a project like this, how it might best be done and looking to the future how the currency might be integrated into the daily functioning of the project. I have been trading a little while but my knowledge is pretty cursory, Stellar has been very good to me and the community is probably least toxic and most reasoned i have come across in the Crypto sphere so thats why im starting here.

All 100B XRP already exist.  38B are inciruclation. 54B are locked up in 55 1B escrows, and the remaining 7B are locked up in a lawsuit.\n\nThe \"printing\" you refer to is actually the company selling XRP to companies with agreements that the will not be sold but used. \n\n&gt;  (the coin has actually 0 use case. yep.

It lets you facilitate multi-currency and asset transactions quickly, reliably, and for a fraction of a penny by using a crypto-asset called Lumens (XLM) as a bridge.\n\n\n* [The Stellar Consensus Protocol | Talks At Google (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmwnhZmEZjc) \n\n\n* [The Stellar Foundation Mandate &amp; Governance] (https://www.stellar.org/about/mandate/)\n\n\n* [Jed McCaleb on Bitcoin &amp; Stellar (video)] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRk2FoEy2Ew)\n\n\n* [How The Stellar Network Operates (pdf)](https://www.stellar.org/how-it-works/stellar-basics/#)\n\n\n* [How Money Moves On Stellar (video)] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA53r43vGCA&amp;t=2s)\n\n\n* [Lumens (XLM) FAQ](https://www.stellar.org/lumens/)\n\n\n##Where Do I Start?\nYou want to start by getting yourself a Stellar Wallet: \n\n* [StellarTerm, A Web-Based Stellar Trading Client] (https://stellarterm.com/) \n\n\n* [Stellar Lumen Wallet Options] (https://www.stellar.org/lumens/wallets/)\n\n\n##Now What?\nGet lumens, build apps, do an ICO, and dive into Stellar:  \n\n\n* [Where To Get Lumens](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/stellar/#markets)\n\n\n* [Raise Funds &amp; ICO On Stellar](https://www.stellar.org/blog/using-stellar-for-ico/) \n\n\n* [Beginner’s Guide To The Stellar Network (for Developers)](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/get-started/)\n\n\n* [Read The Documentation](https://www.stellar.org/developers/)\n\n\n* [Participate In The Stellar Build Challenge (Win Lumens)](https://www.stellar.org/lumens/build/)\n\n\n* [Check Out Stellar Meetups In Your Area] (https://www.meetup.com/preview/Stellar-SF/events/244117321)\n\n* [How To Tip XLM on r/Stellar] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Stellar/comments/7zz8wl/how_to_tip_on_reddit_using_stellar_lumens/)\n\n\n\n=============\n#RULES\n=============\nBelow are the rules that Reddit users on *r/Stellar* must follow to participate.
