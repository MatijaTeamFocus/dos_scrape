Maybe you have too much skin in the game or something if you're itching for announcements this bad. \n\nThe project has an amazing amount going on and has to change deadlines sometimes. This is what industry adoption and organic growth looks like. The kind of chaos they have right now is very good from an investment standpoint(it means they have a metric assload of work happening behind the scenes) because we know they have the financial resources to meet the workload. \n\nThe IF is trying to make this project a success, not a crowd pleaser. There are plenty of other coins if you want to participate in hype markets. Otherwise I would say maybe lower your position a little so you can sleep better. But know that all indicators point towards the IF being successful in their goals, and from a risk standpoint you don't get that kind of confidence anywhere else in crypto.\n\nOr maybe it was just a lighthearted joke :) Best wishes either way!","ups":26,"downs":0,"score":26,"created":1520834054,"depth":0,"comments":""},{"body":"2019 is definitely gonna be IOTA's year.
