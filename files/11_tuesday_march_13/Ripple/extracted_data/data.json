I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention. I do not benefit in any way from this being posted. I just hope it helps. Please note, if you make any mistakes or lose money I will not accept responsibility.\n\n**You trade at your own risk** I accept no responsibility for loss of currency, loss of money or mistakes made.

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open.

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention. I do not benefit in any way from this being posted. I just hope it helps. Please note, if you make any mistakes or lose money I will not accept responsibility.\n\n**You trade at your own risk** I accept no responsibility for loss of currency, loss of money or mistakes made.

Thank you ","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514521539,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"In short, yes. If the price of XRP is at $1 and you buy $500 worth, you would have 500 xrp. But there are small fees when you transfer from one exchange to another and I believe there is a small fee for transferring currencies, but the fees aren't much. Unless you buy BTC to exchange to ripple, then the fee would be about $30 i've heard.","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514836410,"depth":1,"comments":""}]},{"body":"Is there a prediction for the price of ripple early January?","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514583190,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"LOOOOOOOOOOK AT IT NOW !!!!!!!!

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention.

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention. I do not benefit in any way from this being posted. I just hope it helps. Please note, if you make any mistakes or lose money I will not accept responsibility.\n\n**You trade at your own risk** I accept no responsibility for loss of currency, loss of money or mistakes made.

Thank you ","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514521539,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"In short, yes. If the price of XRP is at $1 and you buy $500 worth, you would have 500 xrp. But there are small fees when you transfer from one exchange to another and I believe there is a small fee for transferring currencies, but the fees aren't much. Unless you buy BTC to exchange to ripple, then the fee would be about $30 i've heard.","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514836410,"depth":1,"comments":""}]},{"body":"Is there a prediction for the price of ripple early January?","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514583190,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"LOOOOOOOOOOK AT IT NOW !!!!!!!!

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention.

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention. I do not benefit in any way from this being posted. I just hope it helps. Please note, if you make any mistakes or lose money I will not accept responsibility.\n\n**You trade at your own risk** I accept no responsibility for loss of currency, loss of money or mistakes made.

Thank you ","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514521539,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"In short, yes. If the price of XRP is at $1 and you buy $500 worth, you would have 500 xrp. But there are small fees when you transfer from one exchange to another and I believe there is a small fee for transferring currencies, but the fees aren't much. Unless you buy BTC to exchange to ripple, then the fee would be about $30 i've heard.","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514836410,"depth":1,"comments":""}]},{"body":"Is there a prediction for the price of ripple early January?","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514583190,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"LOOOOOOOOOOK AT IT NOW !!!!!!!!

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention.

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention. I do not benefit in any way from this being posted. I just hope it helps. Please note, if you make any mistakes or lose money I will not accept responsibility.\n\n**You trade at your own risk** I accept no responsibility for loss of currency, loss of money or mistakes made.

Thank you ","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514521539,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"In short, yes. If the price of XRP is at $1 and you buy $500 worth, you would have 500 xrp. But there are small fees when you transfer from one exchange to another and I believe there is a small fee for transferring currencies, but the fees aren't much. Unless you buy BTC to exchange to ripple, then the fee would be about $30 i've heard.","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514836410,"depth":1,"comments":""}]},{"body":"Is there a prediction for the price of ripple early January?","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514583190,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"LOOOOOOOOOOK AT IT NOW !!!!!!!!

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention.

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention. I do not benefit in any way from this being posted. I just hope it helps. Please note, if you make any mistakes or lose money I will not accept responsibility.\n\n**You trade at your own risk** I accept no responsibility for loss of currency, loss of money or mistakes made.

Thank you ","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514521539,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"In short, yes. If the price of XRP is at $1 and you buy $500 worth, you would have 500 xrp. But there are small fees when you transfer from one exchange to another and I believe there is a small fee for transferring currencies, but the fees aren't much. Unless you buy BTC to exchange to ripple, then the fee would be about $30 i've heard.","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514836410,"depth":1,"comments":""}]},{"body":"Is there a prediction for the price of ripple early January?","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514583190,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"LOOOOOOOOOOK AT IT NOW !!!!!!!!

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention.

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention. I do not benefit in any way from this being posted. I just hope it helps. Please note, if you make any mistakes or lose money I will not accept responsibility.\n\n**You trade at your own risk** I accept no responsibility for loss of currency, loss of money or mistakes made.

Thank you ","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514521539,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"In short, yes. If the price of XRP is at $1 and you buy $500 worth, you would have 500 xrp. But there are small fees when you transfer from one exchange to another and I believe there is a small fee for transferring currencies, but the fees aren't much. Unless you buy BTC to exchange to ripple, then the fee would be about $30 i've heard.","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514836410,"depth":1,"comments":""}]},{"body":"Is there a prediction for the price of ripple early January?","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514583190,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"LOOOOOOOOOOK AT IT NOW !!!!!!!!

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention.

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention. I do not benefit in any way from this being posted. I just hope it helps. Please note, if you make any mistakes or lose money I will not accept responsibility.\n\n**You trade at your own risk** I accept no responsibility for loss of currency, loss of money or mistakes made.

Thank you ","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514521539,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"In short, yes. If the price of XRP is at $1 and you buy $500 worth, you would have 500 xrp. But there are small fees when you transfer from one exchange to another and I believe there is a small fee for transferring currencies, but the fees aren't much. Unless you buy BTC to exchange to ripple, then the fee would be about $30 i've heard.","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514836410,"depth":1,"comments":""}]},{"body":"Is there a prediction for the price of ripple early January?","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514583190,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"LOOOOOOOOOOK AT IT NOW !!!!!!!!

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention.

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention. I do not benefit in any way from this being posted. I just hope it helps. Please note, if you make any mistakes or lose money I will not accept responsibility.\n\n**You trade at your own risk** I accept no responsibility for loss of currency, loss of money or mistakes made.

Thank you ","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514521539,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"In short, yes. If the price of XRP is at $1 and you buy $500 worth, you would have 500 xrp. But there are small fees when you transfer from one exchange to another and I believe there is a small fee for transferring currencies, but the fees aren't much. Unless you buy BTC to exchange to ripple, then the fee would be about $30 i've heard.","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514836410,"depth":1,"comments":""}]},{"body":"Is there a prediction for the price of ripple early January?","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514583190,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"LOOOOOOOOOOK AT IT NOW !!!!!!!!

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention.

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention. I do not benefit in any way from this being posted. I just hope it helps. Please note, if you make any mistakes or lose money I will not accept responsibility.\n\n**You trade at your own risk** I accept no responsibility for loss of currency, loss of money or mistakes made.

Thank you ","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514521539,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"In short, yes. If the price of XRP is at $1 and you buy $500 worth, you would have 500 xrp. But there are small fees when you transfer from one exchange to another and I believe there is a small fee for transferring currencies, but the fees aren't much. Unless you buy BTC to exchange to ripple, then the fee would be about $30 i've heard.","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514836410,"depth":1,"comments":""}]},{"body":"Is there a prediction for the price of ripple early January?","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514583190,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"LOOOOOOOOOOK AT IT NOW !!!!!!!!

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention.

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention. I do not benefit in any way from this being posted. I just hope it helps. Please note, if you make any mistakes or lose money I will not accept responsibility.\n\n**You trade at your own risk** I accept no responsibility for loss of currency, loss of money or mistakes made.

Thank you ","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514521539,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"In short, yes. If the price of XRP is at $1 and you buy $500 worth, you would have 500 xrp. But there are small fees when you transfer from one exchange to another and I believe there is a small fee for transferring currencies, but the fees aren't much. Unless you buy BTC to exchange to ripple, then the fee would be about $30 i've heard.","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514836410,"depth":1,"comments":""}]},{"body":"Is there a prediction for the price of ripple early January?","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514583190,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"LOOOOOOOOOOK AT IT NOW !!!!!!!!

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention.

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention. I do not benefit in any way from this being posted. I just hope it helps. Please note, if you make any mistakes or lose money I will not accept responsibility.\n\n**You trade at your own risk** I accept no responsibility for loss of currency, loss of money or mistakes made.

Thank you ","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514521539,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"In short, yes. If the price of XRP is at $1 and you buy $500 worth, you would have 500 xrp. But there are small fees when you transfer from one exchange to another and I believe there is a small fee for transferring currencies, but the fees aren't much. Unless you buy BTC to exchange to ripple, then the fee would be about $30 i've heard.","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514836410,"depth":1,"comments":""}]},{"body":"Is there a prediction for the price of ripple early January?","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514583190,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"LOOOOOOOOOOK AT IT NOW !!!!!!!!

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention.

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention. I do not benefit in any way from this being posted. I just hope it helps. Please note, if you make any mistakes or lose money I will not accept responsibility.\n\n**You trade at your own risk** I accept no responsibility for loss of currency, loss of money or mistakes made.

Thank you ","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514521539,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"In short, yes. If the price of XRP is at $1 and you buy $500 worth, you would have 500 xrp. But there are small fees when you transfer from one exchange to another and I believe there is a small fee for transferring currencies, but the fees aren't much. Unless you buy BTC to exchange to ripple, then the fee would be about $30 i've heard.","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514836410,"depth":1,"comments":""}]},{"body":"Is there a prediction for the price of ripple early January?","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514583190,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"LOOOOOOOOOOK AT IT NOW !!!!!!!!

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention.

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention. I do not benefit in any way from this being posted. I just hope it helps. Please note, if you make any mistakes or lose money I will not accept responsibility.\n\n**You trade at your own risk** I accept no responsibility for loss of currency, loss of money or mistakes made.

Thank you ","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514521539,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"In short, yes. If the price of XRP is at $1 and you buy $500 worth, you would have 500 xrp. But there are small fees when you transfer from one exchange to another and I believe there is a small fee for transferring currencies, but the fees aren't much. Unless you buy BTC to exchange to ripple, then the fee would be about $30 i've heard.","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514836410,"depth":1,"comments":""}]},{"body":"Is there a prediction for the price of ripple early January?","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514583190,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"LOOOOOOOOOOK AT IT NOW !!!!!!!!

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention.

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention. I do not benefit in any way from this being posted. I just hope it helps. Please note, if you make any mistakes or lose money I will not accept responsibility.\n\n**You trade at your own risk** I accept no responsibility for loss of currency, loss of money or mistakes made.

Thank you ","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514521539,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"In short, yes. If the price of XRP is at $1 and you buy $500 worth, you would have 500 xrp. But there are small fees when you transfer from one exchange to another and I believe there is a small fee for transferring currencies, but the fees aren't much. Unless you buy BTC to exchange to ripple, then the fee would be about $30 i've heard.","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514836410,"depth":1,"comments":""}]},{"body":"Is there a prediction for the price of ripple early January?","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514583190,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"LOOOOOOOOOOK AT IT NOW !!!!!!!!

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention.

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention. I do not benefit in any way from this being posted. I just hope it helps. Please note, if you make any mistakes or lose money I will not accept responsibility.\n\n**You trade at your own risk** I accept no responsibility for loss of currency, loss of money or mistakes made.

Thank you ","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514521539,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"In short, yes. If the price of XRP is at $1 and you buy $500 worth, you would have 500 xrp. But there are small fees when you transfer from one exchange to another and I believe there is a small fee for transferring currencies, but the fees aren't much. Unless you buy BTC to exchange to ripple, then the fee would be about $30 i've heard.","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514836410,"depth":1,"comments":""}]},{"body":"Is there a prediction for the price of ripple early January?","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514583190,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"LOOOOOOOOOOK AT IT NOW !!!!!!!!

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention.

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention. I do not benefit in any way from this being posted. I just hope it helps. Please note, if you make any mistakes or lose money I will not accept responsibility.\n\n**You trade at your own risk** I accept no responsibility for loss of currency, loss of money or mistakes made.

Thank you ","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514521539,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"In short, yes. If the price of XRP is at $1 and you buy $500 worth, you would have 500 xrp. But there are small fees when you transfer from one exchange to another and I believe there is a small fee for transferring currencies, but the fees aren't much. Unless you buy BTC to exchange to ripple, then the fee would be about $30 i've heard.","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514836410,"depth":1,"comments":""}]},{"body":"Is there a prediction for the price of ripple early January?","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514583190,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"LOOOOOOOOOOK AT IT NOW !!!!!!!!

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention.

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention. I do not benefit in any way from this being posted. I just hope it helps. Please note, if you make any mistakes or lose money I will not accept responsibility.\n\n**You trade at your own risk** I accept no responsibility for loss of currency, loss of money or mistakes made.

Thank you ","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514521539,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"In short, yes. If the price of XRP is at $1 and you buy $500 worth, you would have 500 xrp. But there are small fees when you transfer from one exchange to another and I believe there is a small fee for transferring currencies, but the fees aren't much. Unless you buy BTC to exchange to ripple, then the fee would be about $30 i've heard.","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514836410,"depth":1,"comments":""}]},{"body":"Is there a prediction for the price of ripple early January?","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514583190,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"LOOOOOOOOOOK AT IT NOW !!!!!!!!

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention.

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention. I do not benefit in any way from this being posted. I just hope it helps. Please note, if you make any mistakes or lose money I will not accept responsibility.\n\n**You trade at your own risk** I accept no responsibility for loss of currency, loss of money or mistakes made.

Thank you ","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514521539,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"In short, yes. If the price of XRP is at $1 and you buy $500 worth, you would have 500 xrp. But there are small fees when you transfer from one exchange to another and I believe there is a small fee for transferring currencies, but the fees aren't much. Unless you buy BTC to exchange to ripple, then the fee would be about $30 i've heard.","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514836410,"depth":1,"comments":""}]},{"body":"Is there a prediction for the price of ripple early January?","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514583190,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"LOOOOOOOOOOK AT IT NOW !!!!!!!!

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention.

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention. I do not benefit in any way from this being posted. I just hope it helps. Please note, if you make any mistakes or lose money I will not accept responsibility.\n\n**You trade at your own risk** I accept no responsibility for loss of currency, loss of money or mistakes made.

Thank you ","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514521539,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"In short, yes. If the price of XRP is at $1 and you buy $500 worth, you would have 500 xrp. But there are small fees when you transfer from one exchange to another and I believe there is a small fee for transferring currencies, but the fees aren't much. Unless you buy BTC to exchange to ripple, then the fee would be about $30 i've heard.","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514836410,"depth":1,"comments":""}]},{"body":"Is there a prediction for the price of ripple early January?","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514583190,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"LOOOOOOOOOOK AT IT NOW !!!!!!!!

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention.

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention. I do not benefit in any way from this being posted. I just hope it helps. Please note, if you make any mistakes or lose money I will not accept responsibility.\n\n**You trade at your own risk** I accept no responsibility for loss of currency, loss of money or mistakes made.

Thank you ","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514521539,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"In short, yes. If the price of XRP is at $1 and you buy $500 worth, you would have 500 xrp. But there are small fees when you transfer from one exchange to another and I believe there is a small fee for transferring currencies, but the fees aren't much. Unless you buy BTC to exchange to ripple, then the fee would be about $30 i've heard.","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514836410,"depth":1,"comments":""}]},{"body":"Is there a prediction for the price of ripple early January?","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514583190,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"LOOOOOOOOOOK AT IT NOW !!!!!!!!

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention.

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention. I do not benefit in any way from this being posted. I just hope it helps. Please note, if you make any mistakes or lose money I will not accept responsibility.\n\n**You trade at your own risk** I accept no responsibility for loss of currency, loss of money or mistakes made.

Thank you ","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514521539,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"In short, yes. If the price of XRP is at $1 and you buy $500 worth, you would have 500 xrp. But there are small fees when you transfer from one exchange to another and I believe there is a small fee for transferring currencies, but the fees aren't much. Unless you buy BTC to exchange to ripple, then the fee would be about $30 i've heard.","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514836410,"depth":1,"comments":""}]},{"body":"Is there a prediction for the price of ripple early January?","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514583190,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"LOOOOOOOOOOK AT IT NOW !!!!!!!!

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention.

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention. I do not benefit in any way from this being posted. I just hope it helps. Please note, if you make any mistakes or lose money I will not accept responsibility.\n\n**You trade at your own risk** I accept no responsibility for loss of currency, loss of money or mistakes made.

Thank you ","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514521539,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"In short, yes. If the price of XRP is at $1 and you buy $500 worth, you would have 500 xrp. But there are small fees when you transfer from one exchange to another and I believe there is a small fee for transferring currencies, but the fees aren't much. Unless you buy BTC to exchange to ripple, then the fee would be about $30 i've heard.","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514836410,"depth":1,"comments":""}]},{"body":"Is there a prediction for the price of ripple early January?","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514583190,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"LOOOOOOOOOOK AT IT NOW !!!!!!!!

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention.

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention. I do not benefit in any way from this being posted. I just hope it helps. Please note, if you make any mistakes or lose money I will not accept responsibility.\n\n**You trade at your own risk** I accept no responsibility for loss of currency, loss of money or mistakes made.

Thank you ","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514521539,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"In short, yes. If the price of XRP is at $1 and you buy $500 worth, you would have 500 xrp. But there are small fees when you transfer from one exchange to another and I believe there is a small fee for transferring currencies, but the fees aren't much. Unless you buy BTC to exchange to ripple, then the fee would be about $30 i've heard.","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514836410,"depth":1,"comments":""}]},{"body":"Is there a prediction for the price of ripple early January?","ups":1,"downs":0,"score":1,"created":1514583190,"depth":0,"comments":[{"body":"LOOOOOOOOOOK AT IT NOW !!!!!!!!

I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).\nThis is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.\n\nIn order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.\n\nYou will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.\n\nThis process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.\nI hope that this guide helps.\n\nGood luck and my your investments make you happy.\nThese instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).\n\n1.\tLog into Coinbase.\n2.\tClick Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).\n3.\tClick Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.\n4.\tClick Buy now.\n5.\tLeave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.\n6.\tAt this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.\n7.\tOn Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.\n8.\tSearch for “ETH” on the left hand side.\n9.\tWhen Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n10.\tCopy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.\n11.\tReturn to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance\n12.\tClick “Accounts” on the top of your screen.\n13.\tGo to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.\n14.\tPaste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.\n15.\tYour Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.\n16.\tYou will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.\n17.\tOn Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select \"basic\".\n18.\tOn the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.\n19.\tIn the search bar,, once you have selected \"ETH\" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.\n20.\tScroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.\n21.\tClick “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.\n22.\tYou can check its value by going back to \"funds\" and then \"withdrawal deposit\" - in the top right hand corner.\n\nI have no affiliation with any of the sites or currencies, or the app I mention.
