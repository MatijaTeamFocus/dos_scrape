Through trial and error, fire and flame, and no small degree of luck, I have recovered the private key for my wallet. It all started when I got a private message from a reddit user named &lt;a href=\"/u/user8528\"&gt;u/user8528&lt;/a&gt;. He had read my comments about performing a RAM dump and how I had very little hope for it because, though I had kept the computer on and Google Chrome open, I had performed the dump 4-5 hours after closing this tab, and had opened several other tabs in the mean time. Unlike myself, &lt;a href=\"/u/user8528\"&gt;u/user8528&lt;/a&gt; was not without hope and asked me how I had actually performed the dump. I forwarded him the tutorial I had followed, thought nothing more about it and returned to mourning the loss of so much money. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually &lt;a href=\"/u/user8528\"&gt;u/user8528&lt;/a&gt; got back to me (after having almost given up himself and I thank the karma gods he didn&amp;#39;t!) and told me he had tested with several private keys and had been able to find them in the RAM dump even 12+ hours (!!!) after they had been generated on the Stellar Account Viewer webpage! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it was with renewed vigour I returned to my dump and spent what must have been 36 hours sifting through 800 million lines of gibberish and physical null values. I kept in close contact with &lt;a href=\"/u/user8528\"&gt;u/user8528&lt;/a&gt; on Discord and we worked together to formulate different approaches. After so many hours of searching, I really had given up all hope and it felt like a second loss to me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I saw something. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We had formulated a truly ridiculous regular expression that had no business ever being written, and I got 23 hits. 22 of those hits were nonsense of the highest order, but one of them looked different. It still contained too many nonsense values to copy and paste easily, so I opened a text editor and started silently mouthing the characters as I read them from between all the garbage.
