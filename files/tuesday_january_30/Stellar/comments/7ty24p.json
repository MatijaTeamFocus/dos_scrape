The increase in value will allow more people to use the bridge.\n\nThe built in inflation is far too miniscule to combat this... try signing up for the pool and you'll see what I mean (you gain 0.0002% per week or 1% a year). \n\nAnd that's the only way to increase the supply. So the argument that inflation will cause the value to stay down doesn't make any sense... \n\nUnless you believe that the amount of adoption Stellar can foster with it's network is less than 1% growth a year it doesn't make sense. Meaning that there's only a 1% increase in demand per year by those using it as a bridge currency.\n\nThat's not very likely let's be honest. Last year alone we got 37 new partners, some of which whom are very large organizations. \n\n\nHence, if Stellar utilizes XLM as a bridge and creates more than 1% demand for that bridge a year XLM appreciates.\n\n(having supply stay the same... supply is only increased by providing Lumens to developers and organizations that further Stellar's impact on the world through real world use cases)\n\nHere's a good post if you want to read more... maybe this should be a post itself..been typing for a while didn't realize it lol... \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Stellar/comments/7o27wc/my_lumen_faq/?utm_source=reddit-android", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A copy and paste of my previous response and a more accurate reddit post regarding the questions posed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In order for an intermediatary currency to work it needs both volume and value.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whose buying and selling currency so you can actually sell your x currency to get Lumens to transfer to Y?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone needs to be willing to sell you a lot of Lumens the market and then someone needs to buy the same amount of Lumens within a few seconds otherwise it won&amp;#39;t work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How will you ever get to utilize Lumens as the bridge. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, if the bridge doesn&amp;#39;t have enough volume - not enough people buying or selling at any one given moment, you&amp;#39;ll end up moving the market up yourself and then down. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A spike up because you bought a lot, the market never responded fast enough and isn&amp;#39;t treating the new high as the norm so the buy orders are still way low. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then when you sell you&amp;#39;re selling to people that were going off the the &amp;quot;old&amp;quot; market norm before you shot up the price so you won&amp;#39;t get the same value back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll basically lose value and won&amp;#39;t successfully be able to send your money to the end destination without suffering a large loss.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Making Lumens not work as a bridge currency. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So for Lumens to work as a bridge currency it needs to be used by a lot of people (which is what creates the volume). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The more people that use it the more value it needs to have since it&amp;#39;s not like dollars where you can just print a billion more everytime you have a shortage. The increase in value will allow more people to use the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The built in inflation is far too miniscule to combat this... try signing up for the pool and you&amp;#39;ll see what I mean (you gain 0.0002% per week or 1% a year). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s the only way to increase the supply. So the argument that inflation will cause the value to stay down doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unless you believe that the amount of adoption Stellar can foster with it&amp;#39;s network is less than 1% growth a year it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense. Meaning that there&amp;#39;s only a 1% increase in demand per year by those using it as a bridge currency.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not very likely let&amp;#39;s be honest.
