Just be careful where you use it.  I also recommend having two accounts, one that stores the bulk of your xlm - which you only access when its necessary.  And another that you use as a middle-man.  Sort of like a savings and checking account.\n\n\nStellarTerm is relatively easy to use.  If its an account that has xlm already in it, you'll see that in your balance.  The next thing you have to do is add Mobius as a trustline, which is also made pretty simple.  Find the \"accept asset tab\" and then select to add MOBI.  Now you're ready to buy at the exchange. \n\n\nHere is a guide Mobius created. https://medium.com/@dgobaud/mobius-stellarterm-guide-7b6a051324ad", "edited": 1517245727.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wow, i didn&amp;#39;t notice smartlands price until you said something.  Great for them and anyone who got in on the ICO! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;WRT StellarTerm. I know what you mean about providing your private key, but it is necessary anytime you want to &amp;quot;access&amp;quot; the stellar network.  Just be careful where you use it.  I also recommend having two accounts, one that stores the bulk of your xlm - which you only access when its necessary.  And another that you use as a middle-man.  Sort of like a savings and checking account.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;StellarTerm is relatively easy to use.  If its an account that has xlm already in it, you&amp;#39;ll see that in your balance.  The next thing you have to do is add Mobius as a trustline, which is also made pretty simple.  Find the &amp;quot;accept asset tab&amp;quot; and then select to add MOBI.
