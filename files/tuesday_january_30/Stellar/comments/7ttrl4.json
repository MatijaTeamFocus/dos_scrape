The difference between Coinbase and Fairx today is about 12+ million users (or all of Coinbase).  Obviously that can change quickly.  Robinhood announced a crypto/fiat service and 5 days later it has something like 1 million on the waitlist.  But whether Fairx can be, or is, \"major\" isn't as important, imo, to solving the *who is the major market maker* question as how it fits into the IBM Universal Payment ecosystem.  Based on how we first learned about the MMM and the context it was given (this is my own opinion now) it is directly related to what IBM and Klickex have started... a continuation of it after the bugs are fixed and concept can be proven.  I think the MMM we were teased with will look a lot more like Klickex than it does Coinbase.  When you look at the geographical location of the IBM validators I'd guess it is London based (lot of UK influenced regions).

The difference between Coinbase and Fairx today is about 12+ million users (or all of Coinbase).  Obviously that can change quickly.  Robinhood announced a crypto/fiat service and 5 days later it has something like 1 million on the waitlist.  But whether Fairx can be, or is, &amp;quot;major&amp;quot; isn&amp;#39;t as important, imo, to solving the &lt;em&gt;who is the major market maker&lt;/em&gt; question as how it fits into the IBM Universal Payment ecosystem.  Based on how we first learned about the MMM and the context it was given (this is my own opinion now) it is directly related to what IBM and Klickex have started... a continuation of it after the bugs are fixed and concept can be proven.
