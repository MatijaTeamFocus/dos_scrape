Through trial and error, fire and flame, and no small degree of luck, I have recovered the private key for my wallet. It all started when I got a private message from a reddit user named &lt;a href=\"/u/user8528\"&gt;u/user8528&lt;/a&gt;. He had read my comments about performing a RAM dump and how I had very little hope for it because, though I had kept the computer on and Google Chrome open, I had performed the dump 4-5 hours after closing this tab, and had opened several other tabs in the mean time. Unlike myself, &lt;a href=\"/u/user8528\"&gt;u/user8528&lt;/a&gt; was not without hope and asked me how I had actually performed the dump. I forwarded him the tutorial I had followed, thought nothing more about it and returned to mourning the loss of so much money. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually &lt;a href=\"/u/user8528\"&gt;u/user8528&lt;/a&gt; got back to me (after having almost given up himself and I thank the karma gods he didn&amp;#39;t!) and told me he had tested with several private keys and had been able to find them in the RAM dump even 12+ hours (!!!) after they had been generated on the Stellar Account Viewer webpage! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it was with renewed vigour I returned to my dump and spent what must have been 36 hours sifting through 800 million lines of gibberish and physical null values. I kept in close contact with &lt;a href=\"/u/user8528\"&gt;u/user8528&lt;/a&gt; on Discord and we worked together to formulate different approaches. After so many hours of searching, I really had given up all hope and it felt like a second loss to me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I saw something. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We had formulated a truly ridiculous regular expression that had no business ever being written, and I got 23 hits. 22 of those hits were nonsense of the highest order, but one of them looked different. It still contained too many nonsense values to copy and paste easily, so I opened a text editor and started silently mouthing the characters as I read them from between all the garbage. There were 56 characters in total. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It couldn&amp;#39;t actually be...&amp;quot; I remember thinking to myself as I nonchalantly copied and pasted it into the Stellar Account Viewer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We had found it.

He deserves it for not giving up when everyone else had, including myself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So hopefully this has been a learning experience for not only me, but for anyone else who followed me on this crazy journey. Protect your private keys. Never rush anything and do your due diligence.

He deserves it for not giving up when everyone else had, including myself. \n\nSo hopefully this has been a learning experience for not only me, but for anyone else who followed me on this crazy journey. Protect your private keys. Never rush anything and do your due diligence. And if you do lose something, don't give up hope, for all that is gold does not glitter, and that is especially poignant when you find yourself sifting through a garbage dump 16GB big. \n\nTL;DR Update on [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stellar/comments/7t3xp8/psa_on_the_importance_of_your_private_key_and_my/), found my key in a dump of RAM.

(Disclaimer: I&amp;#39;m not related to any merchants, these are simply thoughts that I had as a customer. )&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few things that I think are obvious are &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Merchants don&amp;#39;t want to be exposed to the volatility of the markets. If I was a merchant I wouldn&amp;#39;t want to be paid with assets that could lose 50% of its appreciation overnight. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Assets Management: For merchant to be able to receive and be paid with all kinds of crypto currencies, they will have to dedicate tons of resources to mange and secure the digital assets. Like setting up wallets, cold storage, and converting digital assets to fiat etc&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;#39;s Stellar Distributed Exchange which is capable of performing atomic pathfinding between multiple assets. For those who are not familiar atomic pathfinding, it basically allows people to trade cross-assets, like  EUR-&amp;gt;GBP-&amp;gt;XLM-&amp;gt;USD etc. Being atomic means that either the whole process (all the hops) happen successfully or it doesn&amp;#39;t happen at all, meaning you wouldn&amp;#39;t be stuck half way holding GBP when you wanted USD.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you think about it, isn&amp;#39;t SDEX the perfect solution for the problems mentioned above? If merchants use SDEX, they can basically take whatever crypto currencies and receive fiat (provide that asset path can be performed in SDEX) in the end within seconds! And it&amp;#39;s not even limited to just cryptos, you can pay with your native fiat and the merchant and receive their corresponding native fiat as well!

(Disclaimer: I'm not related to any merchants, these are simply thoughts that I had as a customer. )\n\nA few things that I think are obvious are \n\n1. Merchants don't want to be exposed to the volatility of the markets. If I was a merchant I wouldn't want to be paid with assets that could lose 50% of its appreciation overnight. \n2. Assets Management: For merchant to be able to receive and be paid with all kinds of crypto currencies, they will have to dedicate tons of resources to mange and secure the digital assets. Like setting up wallets, cold storage, and converting digital assets to fiat etc\n\nAnd here's Stellar Distributed Exchange which is capable of performing atomic pathfinding between multiple assets. For those who are not familiar atomic pathfinding, it basically allows people to trade cross-assets, like  EUR-&gt;GBP-&gt;XLM-&gt;USD etc. Being atomic means that either the whole process (all the hops) happen successfully or it doesn't happen at all, meaning you wouldn't be stuck half way holding GBP when you wanted USD.\n\nIf you think about it, isn't SDEX the perfect solution for the problems mentioned above? If merchants use SDEX, they can basically take whatever crypto currencies and receive fiat (provide that asset path can be performed in SDEX) in the end within seconds! And it's not even limited to just cryptos, you can pay with your native fiat and the merchant and receive their corresponding native fiat as well! Like paying for stuff on Amazon UK or Amazon Germany with USD, or a more related example, paying for Trezor or Ledger Nano S (both only take EUR I believe?) with USD for 1) a good exchange rate and 2) much much lower fees. \n\n**Why would merchants *want* to accept payments through Stellar's network? Fees**\n\nCurrently the average base fee charged for merchant, per credit card transaction is around 1.5%. So if you are a merchant and every $10,000 you charge, you would pay Visa or Mastercard **at least** $150. \n\nWhereas Stellar only charges [0.00001 XLM **per transaction**](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/concepts/fees.html), so even if XLM is worth $100 each (around $1.6 Trillion market cap) it would still only cost you $0.001 per transaction and that's no matter how large the amount. \n\nWhat are you guys' thoughts? If I made any mistake please correct me. I think Stellar has such huge potential and I'm so excited to see what changes it'll bring about in 2018. Am I fucking dreaming or Stellar or do you think \n\nEdit: [Reference for pathfinding](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/concepts/exchange.html#cross-asset-payments)\n","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"7ty24p","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"clicked":false,"media_embed":{},"report_reasons":null,"author":"VeryDeepLearning","num_crossposts":0,"saved":false,"mod_reports":[],"can_mod_post":false,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"score":38,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":1517287076,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"contest_mode":false,"gilded":0,"downs":0,"brand_safe":true,"secure_media_embed":{},"removal_reason":null,"author_flair_text":null,"stickied":false,"can_gild":false,"thumbnail_height":null,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","name":"t3_7ty24p","spoiler":false,"permalink":"/r/Stellar/comments/7ty24p/sdex_atomic_pathfinding_and_online_merchant/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"hide_score":false,"created":1517311077,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Stellar/comments/7ty24p/sdex_atomic_pathfinding_and_online_merchant/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","quarantine":false,"title":"SDEX, Atomic Pathfinding and Online Merchant Adoption","created_utc":1517282277,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Stellar","ups":38,"media":null,"num_comments":5,"is_self":true,"visited":false,"mod_note":null,"is_video":false,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"self.Stellar","approved_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"num_reports":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2t9ha","thumbnail_width":null,"subreddit":"Stellar","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi &lt;a href=\"/r/Stellar\"&gt;/r/Stellar&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have worked on a simple command line tools to manage your stellar account.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It allow you to:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Generate account&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Import existing account&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Change inflation destination&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Checkout wallet&amp;#39;s informations&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Send lumens&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Show transactions list&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Show detailed transaction&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can install it with:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;NPM: &lt;strong&gt;npm install -g stellar-wallet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://github.com/Lunik/stellar-wallet-cli/releases\"&gt;Download pre-compiled binaries&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compile it your self if you don&amp;#39;t trust me !&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/Lunik/stellar-wallet-cli\"&gt;https://github.com/Lunik/stellar-wallet-cli&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;: This tools is still in Beta, use it at your own risk.
