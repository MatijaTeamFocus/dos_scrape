User Friendliness makes every tech much more intuitive and therefore easier to adopt. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What worries me as well is that a lot of user seem to be under the perception that the \u201estellar desktop client\u201c is some kind of official desktop wallet which it is certainly not. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Considering multi-platform wallets: I myself prefer solutions that are developed respectively for each platform which guarantees to achieve the highest quality on every platform (iOS, Android, windows, macos,..). The Coinbase App for example looks pretty neat and makes it perfectly easy to get involved with cryptocurrencies. Something like that should be considered for the Stellar platform. Especially mobile is an important segment. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "Stellar", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Stellar/comments/7tksia/stellar_has_an_big_imageusability_problem_that/dtd7n5i/", "num_reports": null, "name": "t1_dtd7n5i", "created": 1517182290.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1517153490.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Stellar", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t9ha", "approved_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_7tksia", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t9ha", "approved_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_7tksia", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t9ha", "approved_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_7tksia", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t9ha", "approved_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_7tksia", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t9ha", "approved_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_7tksia", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t9ha", "approved_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_7tksia", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t9ha", "approved_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_7tksia", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t9ha", "approved_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_7tksia", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t9ha", "approved_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_7tksia", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t9ha", "approved_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_7tksia", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dtffsfd", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dev_core", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t1_dtffdqx", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Depends on what you like to do, I'll look into the yad/zenity wrapper in these days anyway.

The reason that things like &amp;quot;instant debit payout&amp;quot; exist is because of trust inherent in the system, and a slow modernization. But Stellar transactions are quick, so there&amp;#39;s less &lt;em&gt;risk&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;no chargebacks&lt;/strong&gt; - this is both a blessing and a curse. Chargebacks are a huge nightmare for retailers (they often write off chargebacks because it&amp;#39;s too much of a hassle to dispute properly), but a protection for users. I think this can be solved via excellent customer service. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s room for a Stripe challenger in this space, if anyone wants to tackle it (i.e., instead of credit card info -&amp;gt; USD in bank account, do crypto -&amp;gt; USD in bank account).
