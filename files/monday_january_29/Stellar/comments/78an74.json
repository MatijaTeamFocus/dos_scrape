As part of its custodial mandate, SDF is entrusted to oversee that the vast majority, 95 billion, of the lumens are distributed to the world.\n\nSDF manages the execution of lumen distribution, with oversight and direction provided by SDF\u2019s Expansion Board. The initial lumens held by SDF are required to be distributed to the world in the following manner:\n\n50% for distribution via the Direct Sign-up Program\n25% for distribution via the Partnership Program\n20% for distribution via the Bitcoin Program\n5% held by SDF to support operational costs\nDirect Signup Program\nThe goal of the Direct Sign-up Program is to make lumens easily accessible to millions of individuals and communities across the globe. By implementing a simple mechanism for distribution featuring a low barrier to entry, we hope to distribute free lumens to millions of individuals.\n\nWe believe the Direct Sign-up Program will help us expand the reach of the network and, subsequently, help achieve our goal of building a more inclusive digital economy. Giving away free lumens is an invitation for communities to learn more about Stellar\u2019s low cost infrastructure, learn more about digital financial assets, and design and build the financial services they need. The availability and active use of lumens on the network will increase the overall network\u2019s utility.\n\nFor these reasons, 50% of the initial lumens are dedicated to the Direct Sign-up Program.\n\nThe Direct Sign-up Program will be conducted in rounds and with a phased roll-out to encourage learning and public awareness throughout the distribution process. We will experiment with various ways to conduct distributions. Any initiative or scheme we implement to support this distribution will serve the implicit purpose of this program: to get a small amount of lumens in the hands of as many people as possible with the intention of promoting financial knowledge and access to financial services around the world.\n\nPartnership Program\nThe purpose of the Partnership Program is to encourage adoption and growth of Stellar through the institutional distribution of lumens. As institutional adoption is a primary driver for scaling usage, the Partnership Program is structured to incentivize key institutional adopters and align their goals with the SDF\u2019s.\n\nMore specifically, the goal of the program is to reward institutions that contribute to the Stellar ecosystem in two core capacities:\n\nBy being an early adopter and contributor to the Stellar ecosystem or;\nBy extending the network\u2019s reach to underserved or financially excluded populations\nTo fund the rewards, 25% of the initial lumens will be set aside for grants to businesses, governments, institutions, or nonprofit organizations that contribute to the growth of the Stellar ecosystem.\n\nFor more information about current partnership programs, please visit the Stellar Partnership Grant Program page.\n\nBitcoin Program\nSDF allocated 20% of the initial lumens to be distributed for free to holders of bitcoin and XRP (19% for bitcoin holders and 1% for XRP holders).\n\nThe goal of this giveaway was to encourage bitcoin holders to explore and use Stellar, encourage exchanges to support lumen trading, promote the development of useful Stellar ecosystem technologies, and encourage Stellar integrations by financial institutions and service providers. With more people holding lumens and transacting on the network, the network itself will become more useful to those who build low-cost services on it.\n\nThe Bitcoin Program was completed in two rounds: one round was completed in October 2016 and another was completed in August 2017. SDF does not intend to conduct another round of lumen distributions to bitcoin or XRP holders.\n\nMembers and Directors of SDF were not eligible to participate in the bitcoin program for any bitcoins or XRP that they hold during the claim period.\n\nUnclaimed Lumens and Stellar Build Challenge\nLumens that were not claimed by during the Bitcoin program are currently going to the Stellar Build Challenge and toward the operations of SDF. The Stellar Build Challenge rewards development, education, usage, and integrations in the Stellar ecosystem by awarding lumen to the creators of useful technologies, resources, and applications. For more information, please refer to the Stellar Build Challenge page.\n\nHeld by Foundation\nIn order to provide market stability to lumens, SDF founders and Stripe have voluntarily agreed not to sell any of the lumens initially received (either via employee grants in the case of the founders, or via repayment of the Stripe loan) for at least five years. However, Stripe may auction any of their lumens, provided the recipients also agree not to sell their lumens for five years, and net profits will be returned to the Foundation.\n\nInflation\nThe Stellar Network has a built-in, fixed, nominal inflation mechanism. New lumens are added to the network at the rate of 1% each year. Each week, the protocol distributes these lumens to any account that gets over .05% of the 'votes' from other accounts in the network.\"\n\nhttps://www.stellar.org/about/mandate/", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Funding\nSDF employs full-time and part-time employees, as well as contractors, to develop and execute programs that promote global financial access, literacy, and inclusion.
