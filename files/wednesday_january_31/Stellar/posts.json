Info here:\n\nhttps://www.ibm.com/blogs/events/think-2018/think-2018-presents/think-2018-blockchain/\n\nOk, so we know Stellar is in the same boat as IBM and was specifically used for their projects with Maersk. This is what IBM writes: \"In a recent test by Maersk, the world’s largest shipping container firm, one container of flowers was tracked from Kenya to the Netherlands.\"\n\nIBM then goes on to describe how they use blockchain tech for many applications. Heres a bit i found particularly interesting:\n\n\"IBM is collaborating with Walmart and other global food companies to make the food supply chain safer by putting it on IBM Blockchain. Bridget’s mandate includes leading IBM’s 12 Global Industries and building solutions specific to industry needs. She is responsible for ___IBM’s global strategic partnerships including Apple, SAP, Workday, and Salesforce.___\"\n\nIBM is in the same boat as Walmart and Apple. Unless i am missing something here, this is absolutely huge news. I thought the Maersk news was huge, but this, to me, signals that IBM shills /our/ structures towards clients like Walmart and Apple. I realize IBM has never promised to go exclusively for Stellar, but i have never heard of them taking their business elsewhere. I also realise that neither IBM nor Stellar can go out right now and explicitly connect the dots between Stellar and the likes of Walmart and Apple. Nevertheless, this has huge potential.

think?","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"7u9go6","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"clicked":false,"media_embed":{},"report_reasons":null,"author":"ToppestLobster","num_crossposts":0,"saved":false,"mod_reports":[],"can_mod_post":false,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"score":51,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"preview":{"images":[{"source":{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/kV7P8ohjzjOcv7uhZDmFT1Bhlwk8dQ8mU-UYuF_XYtQ.jpg?s=409317505d49b68d42d274a4397a6ca4","width":800,"height":540},"resolutions":[{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/kV7P8ohjzjOcv7uhZDmFT1Bhlwk8dQ8mU-UYuF_XYtQ.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=2b5e6902773b736ac7ceeb6b2c826c95","width":108,"height":72},{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/kV7P8ohjzjOcv7uhZDmFT1Bhlwk8dQ8mU-UYuF_XYtQ.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=ce81a224a25d851e42d64379d6e7f767","width":216,"height":145},{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/kV7P8ohjzjOcv7uhZDmFT1Bhlwk8dQ8mU-UYuF_XYtQ.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=55167077928d3f3318c6f3bddf8310ec","width":320,"height":216},{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/kV7P8ohjzjOcv7uhZDmFT1Bhlwk8dQ8mU-UYuF_XYtQ.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=2a9b9a4a9d6d047a6a148df4d5769637","width":640,"height":432}],"variants":{},"id":"4X8CXJZ3vEU82H7fVfAvTfIZ7UcqTlXi6sDFPwfY3xM"}],"enabled":false},"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"contest_mode":false,"gilded":0,"downs":0,"brand_safe":true,"secure_media_embed":{},"removal_reason":null,"post_hint":"self","author_flair_text":null,"stickied":false,"can_gild":false,"thumbnail_height":null,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","name":"t3_7u9go6","spoiler":false,"permalink":"/r/Stellar/comments/7u9go6/ibm_conference_in_may_walmart_and_apple_partners/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"hide_score":false,"created":1517429519,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Stellar/comments/7u9go6/ibm_conference_in_may_walmart_and_apple_partners/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","quarantine":false,"title":"IBM

Through trial and error, fire and flame, and no small degree of luck, I have recovered the private key for my wallet. It all started when I got a private message from a reddit user named &lt;a href=\"/u/user8528\"&gt;u/user8528&lt;/a&gt;. He had read my comments about performing a RAM dump and how I had very little hope for it because, though I had kept the computer on and Google Chrome open, I had performed the dump 4-5 hours after closing this tab, and had opened several other tabs in the mean time. Unlike myself, &lt;a href=\"/u/user8528\"&gt;u/user8528&lt;/a&gt; was not without hope and asked me how I had actually performed the dump. I forwarded him the tutorial I had followed, thought nothing more about it and returned to mourning the loss of so much money. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually &lt;a href=\"/u/user8528\"&gt;u/user8528&lt;/a&gt; got back to me (after having almost given up himself and I thank the karma gods he didn&amp;#39;t!) and told me he had tested with several private keys and had been able to find them in the RAM dump even 12+ hours (!!!) after they had been generated on the Stellar Account Viewer webpage! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it was with renewed vigour I returned to my dump and spent what must have been 36 hours sifting through 8 million lines of gibberish and null values. I kept in close contact with &lt;a href=\"/u/user8528\"&gt;u/user8528&lt;/a&gt; on Discord and we worked together to formulate different approaches. After so many hours of searching, I really had given up all hope and it felt like a second loss to me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I saw something. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We had formulated a truly ridiculous regular expression that had no business ever being written, and I got 23 hits. 22 of those hits were nonsense of the highest order, but one of them looked different. It still contained too many invisible values to copy and paste easily, so I opened a text editor and started silently mouthing the important characters as I read them from between all the garbage. There were 56 characters in total. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It couldn&amp;#39;t actually be...&amp;quot; I remember thinking to myself as I nonchalantly copied and pasted it into the Stellar Account Viewer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We had found it.
