SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello crypto colleagues&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have invested in an ICO called STORIQA (STQ) with many others (over 50,000 investors). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When investing, I read the whitepaper, roadmap, you name it since I was very hesitant with ico’s (so many scams). And there was no mention of a KYC Know Your Customer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I was like OK. I will tip my toes in the waters and invest 550$. What do you know, 2 weeks later (now 31/01) they are telling us they will need our social information in order to receive the STQ Tokens. (Passport, Id, email, social security number was mentioned too). Which means my tokens are basically held hostage if I dont comply.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2 things worry me about this: \n1 they obviously hid the KYC in order to get as many investors as possible.

And there was no mention of a KYC Know Your Customer.\n\nSo I was like OK. I will tip my toes in the waters and invest 550$. What do you know, 2 weeks later (now 31/01) they are telling us they will need our social information in order to receive the STQ Tokens. (Passport, Id, email, social security number was mentioned too). Which means my tokens are basically held hostage if I dont comply.\n\n2 things worry me about this: \n1 they obviously hid the KYC in order to get as many investors as possible.

They will link you to the correct lessons for questions you fuck up on. Very, very good resource. Do  not discount TA in this market. It is very, very useful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then study: &lt;a href=\"http://www.tradingview.com\"&gt;www.tradingview.com&lt;/a&gt; This site is amazing. Not only is this tool free, it is also very, very easy to use. You can apply anything you learned from the lessons above and easily apply it to tradingview.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, practice: Don&amp;#39;t go balls deep. Don&amp;#39;t try and short the market with big moves. Learn with little ones. Use cheap shitcoins to practice. Don&amp;#39;t look for serious gains and instead just look for making a &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; play. You will learn from &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; calls and mistakes all the same regardless of how much money you put into it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other suggestions: Use podcasts, social media, and Reddit. Learn from the community/each other. There are also great youtube channels out there that do a fantastic job of explaining TA tools.

In order to maintain this fake demand that they have created, they constantly need excess Tether whenever the market tries to dip for whatever reasons. However, the more they print USDT, it increases the exposure and people start to exit Tether.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Media FUD. The media has been very incompetent and behind in understanding crypto in general. I am sure they are being pressured to FUD the market, but they seem to be unaware of the biggest and the most legitimate concern in the cryptosphere at the moment. If they sniff this out and start their FUD campaign, it could trigger a panic sell.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;External sources which may serve as a heavy downward pressure. The stock markets and the housing markets seem to be around its peak globally, and when those start to come down, it will create a heavy downward pressure in the market as money starts to pull out, possibly too heavy for Tether to handle.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Government regulation stepping in to stop the this blatant fraudulent activity. It will happen sooner or later but when this happens, it will be a showstopper for sure. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bitfinex decides to exit. They are registered on British Virgin Islands after all. Although they may be corrupt, these are very smart people and have been successfully running a scam in the crypto market thus far on a global scale. I&amp;#39;m sure they see people starting to catch up to what is really going on and have their exit strategy planned. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever the trigger is, it is bound to happen one day. I&amp;#39;d rather have it happen sooner than later since getting it rid of it once and for all earlier will be better for the market in the long run. Once the fuse finally goes off, I suspect it will look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Tether price starts to plummet as the masses quickly realize that the USDT bags they are holding is worthless and start to sell them at a loss. USDT price will plummet while BTC/USDT price will spike up momentarily. It will eventually get to a desperation point where people take heavy losses to get out. Many people will be hopelessly trapped holding USDT bags like people trapped in a burning building about to collapse and it will mean certain end for them. They will see all their crypto assets vaporize before their eyes within minutes. Half the world who will be sleeping when this happens , whether they are tethered in or not, will wake up to find a large chunk of their portfolio gone.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Arbitration bots will be in full drive, further spiking up the value of BTC for a short period of time. However, with the artificial demand gone, it will inevitably start to plummet.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;This downward momentum will only be exacerbated by people who got out of USDT and those who are aware of these issues trying to convert everything to fiat and exit the market as soon as possible. People will be fiating out in droves. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The induced panic sell coupled with a sharp drop in BTC will ripple around the globe and exchanges will be clogged down by the sheer volume of people trying to get out and may even become unserviceable for a short term. This will create more panic and add to the momentum. Think back to the Korea FUD and how a simple news by a minister triggered a sell frenzy. This will be much, much worse. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;People that were sleeping wake up, see the bloodbath and sell their bags. The media FUD ensues, the whole thing will go off like a chain reaction, rushing for the new bottom every hour. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; Every coin is tied to BTC. this downward spiral will take BTC to a very low ground and subsequently take all alts and the whole market with it. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Doomsday.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no realistic idea of when it is going to blow or how bad it will be or what its short term and long term effects will be for the market. I personally think when it happens, it will effectively take out 50-80% of the current market cap over the period of a few days. Again, I have no idea when, but I am certain it will go off in the future. It&amp;#39;s good that you are paying attention to these issues now so that you don&amp;#39;t completely get caught with your pants down when it happens. Keep a close eye on Tether and make contingency plans in the meantime. I can only say the best of luck to everybody when this eventually blows up and I really do hope that I am horribly wrong in my predictions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"The scope of the implications on what I believe will be an inevitable crypto market crash and how it will unfurl is complicated to say the least but let's first examine some facts about the Tether situation.\n\n1.

If they sniff this out and start their FUD campaign, it could trigger a panic sell.\n3. External sources which may serve as a heavy downward pressure. The stock markets and the housing markets seem to be around its peak globally, and when those start to come down, it will create a heavy downward pressure in the market as money starts to pull out, possibly too heavy for Tether to handle.\n4. Government regulation stepping in to stop the this blatant fraudulent activity. It will happen sooner or later but when this happens, it will be a showstopper for sure. \n5. Bitfinex decides to exit. They are registered on British Virgin Islands after all. Although they may be corrupt, these are very smart people and have been successfully running a scam in the crypto market thus far on a global scale. I'm sure they see people starting to catch up to what is really going on and have their exit strategy planned. \n\nWhatever the trigger is, it is bound to happen one day. I'd rather have it happen sooner than later since getting it rid of it once and for all earlier will be better for the market in the long run. Once the fuse finally goes off, I suspect it will look something like this:\n\n1. Tether price starts to plummet as the masses quickly realize that the USDT bags they are holding is worthless and start to sell them at a loss. USDT price will plummet while BTC/USDT price will spike up momentarily. It will eventually get to a desperation point where people take heavy losses to get out. Many people will be hopelessly trapped holding USDT bags like people trapped in a burning building about to collapse and it will mean certain end for them. They will see all their crypto assets vaporize before their eyes within minutes. Half the world who will be sleeping when this happens , whether they are tethered in or not, will wake up to find a large chunk of their portfolio gone.\n2. Arbitration bots will be in full drive, further spiking up the value of BTC for a short period of time. However, with the artificial demand gone, it will inevitably start to plummet.\n3. This downward momentum will only be exacerbated by people who got out of USDT and those who are aware of these issues trying to convert everything to fiat and exit the market as soon as possible. People will be fiating out in droves. \n4. The induced panic sell coupled with a sharp drop in BTC will ripple around the globe and exchanges will be clogged down by the sheer volume of people trying to get out and may even become unserviceable for a short term. This will create more panic and add to the momentum. Think back to the Korea FUD and how a simple news by a minister triggered a sell frenzy. This will be much, much worse. \n5. People that were sleeping wake up, see the bloodbath and sell their bags. The media FUD ensues, the whole thing will go off like a chain reaction, rushing for the new bottom every hour. \n6.  Every coin is tied to BTC. this downward spiral will take BTC to a very low ground and subsequently take all alts and the whole market with it. \n7. Doomsday.\n\nI have no realistic idea of when it is going to blow or how bad it will be or what its short term and long term effects will be for the market. I personally think when it happens, it will effectively take out 50-80% of the current market cap over the period of a few days. Again, I have no idea when, but I am certain it will go off in the future. It's good that you are paying attention to these issues now so that you don't completely get caught with your pants down when it happens. Keep a close eye on Tether and make contingency plans in the meantime. I can only say the best of luck to everybody when this eventually blows up and I really do hope that I am horribly wrong in my predictions.","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"link_flair_text":"WARNING","id":"7u5y3x","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"clicked":false,"media_embed":{},"report_reasons":null,"author":"FatCatFetish","num_crossposts":0,"saved":false,"mod_reports":[],"can_mod_post":false,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"score":0,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":"WARNING","author_flair_css_class":"noflair","contest_mode":false,"gilded":0,"downs":0,"brand_safe":true,"secure_media_embed":{},"removal_reason":null,"author_flair_text":"","stickied":false,"can_gild":false,"thumbnail_height":null,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","name":"t3_7u5y3x","spoiler":false,"permalink":"/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7u5y3x/how_i_believe_the_tether_situation_will_play_out/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"hide_score":false,"created":1517389128,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7u5y3x/how_i_believe_the_tether_situation_will_play_out/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","quarantine":false,"title":"How I believe the Tether situation will play out.

This is because we all believe the market is going to keep rising, even if we act like we don&amp;#39;t think so, we know there is nothing else that can provide us with this potential to earn, deep down we all want it to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Enter Tether, it is a form of confidence, a way of saying well we want to to do this but if it all fucks up at least we can step out and act like it didn&amp;#39;t happen. This is increases our desire to see how far things can go, giving confidence, but this is only practical as it is capable to survive a market crash. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me put it this way, once the concern that the bubble really has burst comes to mainstream attention, all the market is is essentially what Tether or other limited forms of liquidity can provide for us to buy out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But at the end of the day pursuing any of these things are accepting the burst of bubble, the decline of the market.....while still somehow oddly accepting that this technology wont ever become anything, even though it is proving to investors how profitable it can become on efficiency alone, otherwise it would not have the peaks it does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously, if we all buyout and crash the market we will have to eventually buy back in with no gains. The market is going the way of digital currency whether we want it or not. At least now we have the power to determine this structure globally rather than for any particular interest. The volatility is a necessary defense of the market from outside interest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Enter the solution: Proof of Weak Hands&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What essentially happens in a crash is that the weak hands try to gain power before it is taken from them, but what they are actively doing is buying out of a flawed system. If we build the system right it wont be flawed here is why: right now, nothing is dependent upon the crypto market in the way people were dependent upon banks in all of the global market crashes.  You should not have invested more than you can afford to lose, which means this entire market is built upon excess capital. This is why those technologies that fail to produce can be tossed aside while we keep looking for what works. This is the point. Even if you invested more than you should have, the point is we do not have any existing infrastructure, thus this global market is still building and can be designed to avoid the issue of banks. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tether is an antiquated idea, the whole point of all of this is to overcome fiat in place of a smart economy. If the USD crashed and you bought up all the gold, what the fuck are you going to do with that.....if USD crashed you cannot buy a fucking market with gold. You need an active economy to be able to buy anything, and you need to buy things no matter who you are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The idea the confidence of crypto is built on its relationship to fiat is so stupid. I am sorry. We need a way to store our value inside the system, a way we can be confident the technology wont go anywhere, and as long as money is in crypto it will have value. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is what PoWH coin accomplishes. Completely decentralized, peer to peer with established and agreed upon rates. Designed to meet the market conditions while still being sustainable when the market becomes volatile.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is a way for us to store value in a bear market. Nobody wants to cash out yet because they don&amp;#39;t want to report gains, but also because they think this will ultimately become the way we will transact value.

Don&amp;#39;t you guys get it....we finally made something that&amp;#39;s worth reposting forever.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"Nobody is ready to cash out yet, except those that have earned so much they aren't saying anything anymore (you can pm me if you want). This is because we all believe the market is going to keep rising, even if we act like we don't think so, we know there is nothing else that can provide us with this potential to earn, deep down we all want it to succeed.\n\nEnter Tether, it is a form of confidence, a way of saying well we want to to do this but if it all fucks up at least we can step out and act like it didn't happen. This is increases our desire to see how far things can go, giving confidence, but this is only practical as it is capable to survive a market crash. \n\nLet me put it this way, once the concern that the bubble really has burst comes to mainstream attention, all the market is is essentially what Tether or other limited forms of liquidity can provide for us to buy out.\n\nBut at the end of the day pursuing any of these things are accepting the burst of bubble, the decline of the market.....while still somehow oddly accepting that this technology wont ever become anything, even though it is proving to investors how profitable it can become on efficiency alone, otherwise it would not have the peaks it does.\n\nObviously, if we all buyout and crash the market we will have to eventually buy back in with no gains. The market is going the way of digital currency whether we want it or not. At least now we have the power to determine this structure globally rather than for any particular interest. The volatility is a necessary defense of the market from outside interest.\n\nEnter the solution: Proof of Weak Hands\n\nWhat essentially happens in a crash is that the weak hands try to gain power before it is taken from them, but what they are actively doing is buying out of a flawed system. If we build the system right it wont be flawed here is why: right now, nothing is dependent upon the crypto market in the way people were dependent upon banks in all of the global market crashes.  You should not have invested more than you can afford to lose, which means this entire market is built upon excess capital. This is why those technologies that fail to produce can be tossed aside while we keep looking for what works. This is the point. Even if you invested more than you should have, the point is we do not have any existing infrastructure, thus this global market is still building and can be designed to avoid the issue of banks. \n\nTether is an antiquated idea, the whole point of all of this is to overcome fiat in place of a smart economy. If the USD crashed and you bought up all the gold, what the fuck are you going to do with that.....if USD crashed you cannot buy a fucking market with gold. You need an active economy to be able to buy anything, and you need to buy things no matter who you are.\n\nThe idea the confidence of crypto is built on its relationship to fiat is so stupid. I am sorry. We need a way to store our value inside the system, a way we can be confident the technology wont go anywhere, and as long as money is in crypto it will have value. \n\nThis is what PoWH coin accomplishes. Completely decentralized, peer to peer with established and agreed upon rates. Designed to meet the market conditions while still being sustainable when the market becomes volatile.\n\nIt is a way for us to store value in a bear market. Nobody wants to cash out yet because they don't want to report gains, but also because they think this will ultimately become the way we will transact value. Thus when the bear market arrives, putting money in PoWH instead of Tether insures that value stays relatively steady due to its structure, there no potential for exit scam, and the PoWH value grows indirectly to the markets decline. \n\nIt rewards people that stay invested in crypto even when the mainstream market is done. If enough people sold that the that PoWH crashed, it would most likely be because there are better places to have money invest, which means that the entire market is going to rise both in confidence and growth. \n\nThus when those same sellers return to store value once the bear market comes back, those iron hands that stayed in after they missed the peak to sell PoWH will see insane dividends as the market starts to settle. They will be compensated for keeping PoWH alive, and all the sellers would have a place to keep their currency alive while the market bleeds out the unneccesary technology. \n\nIf we keep taking out gains from the system for fiat we give more power to the governments and banks (and also rise the value of their stake in fiat) to design how the digital economy is built and we make it harder and harder for good technology to develop.\n\nYou could say someone is getting scammed with PoWH because it is perceptually a pyramid scheme, but it sustains itself, rewards those who are patient, and keeps the entire cryptomarket solvent. \n\n\nThis is the killer app of Crypto, seriously.

SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am in my mid-forties and lived through the dot-com bubble. I built websites for some great and not-so great companies.  I owned some shares of companies that we all know very well today.  When the dot-com bubble burst I was in my mid-twenties.  I listened to everyone around me as they told me the Internet was a bubble.  I gave up my Internet dreams and hopes of fortune, sold the stocks, and invested in myself… I went back to school.  If I had kept working in the Internet business, if I have kept those stocks….&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many years later I am in the same spot again.  And this time, I will not make the same mistake again. I will not sell the cryptos I really believe in today because I know they will be worth so much more in the future. Tonight, I plan to tell this story in the not so distant future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I bought my cryptos and rode them through the highs and lows.  During January of 2018 the entire world was shouting at me that I was a fool in a bubble.  Family, friends, media - it is just a bubble is all I heard.  Then the regulation rumors, and worse the Tether rumors.  I held through all of them.  And then on January 30, with the US stock market selling off, the crypto markets started selling off again.  And selling hard.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I held. When everyone said sell, I held.  And now many years in the future I can say, I bought Ripple for under twenty cents each.  And with 500% gains, in the face of the world telling me it was a bubble.  I held.  And now many years later, I am…. Wealthy.  Very very wealthy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it’s not just Ripple, it’s Stellar, Cardano, Litecoin. (Insert your favorites here.) I held.  And I was patient. Unlike what I did in the dot-com burst, I did not let fear and the world dictate what I knew then was true.  I knew the Internet would change the world, but I was not patient.  I will give these block-chain technologies the time they need to mature.  I will give the industry the time it needs to grow.  And in the end, I will be successful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am not a trader.  I cannot catch these falling knives each week.  I am in this for the long haul.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My prediction is this.  The U.S. stock market, bond market, cryptos and even gold and silver sold off today.  There was no place to hide.  Investors are holding ridiculous amounts of cash - cash that is also losing value.  The stock market will take off tomorrow after Trump’s speech, which I am betting will be very pro business and will rally traders tomorrow.  After the stock market hits new highs, the investors will want new places to invest… cryptos will be waiting.  As the Lunar New Year ends, and investors seek better returns cryptos will come back.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tonight is not the night to sell.  Tonight is the night to plan your story.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"I am in my mid-forties and lived through the dot-com bubble. I built websites for some great and not-so great companies.  I owned some shares of companies that we all know very well today.  When the dot-com bubble burst I was in my mid-twenties.  I listened to everyone around me as they told me the Internet was a bubble.  I gave up my Internet dreams and hopes of fortune, sold the stocks, and invested in myself… I went back to school.  If I had kept working in the Internet business, if I have kept those stocks….\n\nMany years later I am in the same spot again.  And this time, I will not make the same mistake again. I will not sell the cryptos I really believe in today because I know they will be worth so much more in the future. Tonight, I plan to tell this story in the not so distant future.\n\nI bought my cryptos and rode them through the highs and lows.  During January of 2018 the entire world was shouting at me that I was a fool in a bubble.  Family, friends, media - it is just a bubble is all I heard.  Then the regulation rumors, and worse the Tether rumors.  I held through all of them.  And then on January 30, with the US stock market selling off, the crypto markets started selling off again.  And selling hard.   \n\nI held. When everyone said sell, I held.  And now many years in the future I can say, I bought Ripple for under twenty cents each.  And with 500% gains, in the face of the world telling me it was a bubble.  I held.  And now many years later, I am…. Wealthy.  Very very wealthy.\n\nAnd it’s not just Ripple, it’s Stellar, Cardano, Litecoin. (Insert your favorites here.) I held.  And I was patient. Unlike what I did in the dot-com burst, I did not let fear and the world dictate what I knew then was true.  I knew the Internet would change the world, but I was not patient.  I will give these block-chain technologies the time they need to mature.  I will give the industry the time it needs to grow.  And in the end, I will be successful.\n\nI am not a trader.  I cannot catch these falling knives each week.  I am in this for the long haul.\n\nMy prediction is this.  The U.S. stock market, bond market, cryptos and even gold and silver sold off today.  There was no place to hide.  Investors are holding ridiculous amounts of cash - cash that is also losing value.  The stock market will take off tomorrow after Trump’s speech, which I am betting will be very pro business and will rally traders tomorrow.  After the stock market hits new highs, the investors will want new places to invest… cryptos will be waiting.  As the Lunar New Year ends, and investors seek better returns cryptos will come back.  \n\nTonight is not the night to sell.  Tonight is the night to plan your story.  \n","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"link_flair_text":"FOCUSED DISCUSSION","id":"7u5pj6","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"clicked":false,"media_embed":{},"report_reasons":null,"author":"Kreel25","num_crossposts":0,"saved":false,"mod_reports":[],"can_mod_post":false,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"score":1236,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":"DISCUSSION","author_flair_css_class":"Training","contest_mode":false,"gilded":0,"downs":0,"brand_safe":true,"secure_media_embed":{},"removal_reason":null,"author_flair_text":"Redditor for 3 months.","stickied":false,"can_gild":false,"thumbnail_height":null,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","name":"t3_7u5pj6","spoiler":false,"permalink":"/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7u5pj6/why_i_hodl_my_past_and_my_story_from_the_future/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"hide_score":false,"created":1517386916,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7u5pj6/why_i_hodl_my_past_and_my_story_from_the_future/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","quarantine":false,"title":"Why I HODL?
